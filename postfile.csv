0,September 28,benjaminhf,"This seems like a good deal in terms of used entry-level luxury—a 2015 Acura TLX 2.4 with 50k miles for $15.9k:

https://www.acuraatoxmoor.com/used/Acura/2015-Acura-TLX-fcaa14f30a0e0a6b0a96f79e5affff39.htm

Strange but true, this is c.$2000 less than a 2015 Accord EXL with about the same miles at another local dealer:

https://www.louisvillehondaworld.com/used-Jefferson+County-2015-Honda-Accord-EX+L-1HGCR2F83FA029458

Having owned four Accords, I can say that in almost every way a TLX is significantly better than an Accord. The rear seat is a little less roomy in the TLX, but otherwise...."
1,September 28,stickguy,"nice color combo on the TLX. But I really don't like these without the tech package. At least the 2018s base have a lot more stuff on them.

2,September 28,benjaminhf,"Yeah, the Tech package for the TLX is expensive (c.$3700 iirc), but it does add some nice stuff—blind spot monitors, cross traffic alert, ELS sound system, Milano leather seats (which even smell nice imho), rain-sensing wipers, built-in navi (which I have used a few times), and AcuraLink concierge (which I've not yet used at all). Plus, as you say, the 2018s and later get CarPlay/AndroidAuto as well as Acurawatch.

But for about the price of a new base Elantra, I'd say that I'd take the TLX for 15.9k any day. Still has that nice engine and transmission combo, 4-wheel steering, etc., etc."
3,October 3,benjaminhf,"Thinking about the idea @stickguy had of keeping an Acura for ten years, I came across videos by a guy named Tyson Hugie who has over 200,000 miles on his Acura ILX, and over half a million miles on his Legend. This is making me think that if I take care of it, drive carefully, and have some luck, that keeping my 2018 TLX past 100k might be possible. I already have over 5000 miles on it, even though I've only leased it for a little over 3 months. (My wife's 2018 CR-V already has about 6k miles on it.) Anyway, here's the video about his ILX. His 25 year old Legend has made it past 500k with its original engine and transmission."

2018 Hyundai Elantra Sport (mine), and 2013 Acura RDX AWD (wife's)"
6,October 4,benjaminhf,"But falling sales for ELL cars probably helps to make for the possibility of good deals....

Perhaps I'm the only one to regret it, but it looks like starting next year that lower-powered ELLs won't really be available. Currently the 320i has a 0-60 time, according to BMW, of 7.1 seconds. The Acura TLX 2.4 I have has been timed at 6.9 seconds, which is fast enough for me (and about half a second faster than my 2016 Accord CVT). But for the new generation of 3-series coming up it looks like they've not only eliminated the manual transmission but also taken out the less powerful version. So the lowest level of 2019 330i will have a 0-60 time of less than 6 seconds—but it will also cost c.$6k more than the current bottom-of-the-line 320i. Rumors are that the all-new 2020 Acura TLX will also have an standard 2-liter turbo engine with similar power and acceleration.

That's probably what almost all ELL buyers want in terms of power and acceleration, but once the least expensive 3-series starts at c.$42k msrp before options it might be out of reach for some who might otherwise buy it.

And I'm enjoying that on highway drives without ac I can get as much as 40 mpg with my 2018 TLX with the naturally aspirated 2.4 with the 8-speed transmission. I don't think a 2020 TLX with the 2.0 turbo will be able to get more than maybe 35 on the same drive, but obviously I don't know for sure. I assume that as with the 330i there will be a big price jump for the 2020 TLX. I could afford the current TLX, but the next one might be too rich for my blood....

Finally, if you really are trying to keep a car past 10 years and 100k miles, then perhaps a naturally aspirated engine might be more reliable in the long run?"
7,October 4,stickguy,"But, will be nice if they keep the pricing like the 4, but it has performance of the V6 which I assume is going away.

8,October 4,benjaminhf,"stickguy said:

Yeah, given falling sales for almost all entry-level cars, Acura might not have much room to raise prices.

Here's my guess....the msrp for the base model 2020 TLX might only go up by c.$2k or so, but at the same time (as with the Accord) they will really cut back on lease incentives. In other words, my guess is that the ""real"" price increase might be more like $5k—almost the same price increase as for the BMW 330i—although like today a TLX will still undercut a comparable 330i by thousands of collars. My lease deal was almost too good, in that I could lease a TLX 2.4 Tech for less than an Accord EXL 2.4. I think that will almost certainly not be possible for the 2020 TLX."
9,October 4,stickguy,"Most of the time, when I have checked, the Acura lease offers were not particularly good. I think you were right place, right time!

I could see the redesign base model being priced like the current tech car, but with some of those features standard.

10,October 4,stickguy,"was not actually expecting one, but looks like Acura spent some money on updating the ILX. will be interested in seeing it in person. already had the TLX drivetrain, now seems to have the interior. Hopefully they did some updates to the driving dynamics too.

11,12:14AM,carnaught,Like that new ILX. Some may critcize it as overstyled but I tend to like a little over styled.
12,1:31AM,benjaminhf,"AcuraWatch is now standard on the base 2019 ILX, instead of being a $1300 option. On top of that they've cut the base price by $2300. And so really it's a price cut of about $3500, which shows how much Acura hopes to get some sales. The ILX is now seemingly a good deal for the money, esp compared to say an Audi A3, which comparably equipped costs almost $10k more. The base msrp of the ILX is now $25,900. Unfortunately Acura didn't put CarPlay/AndroidAuto into the base model. But for $27,650 you can get the ILX Premium which adds CarPlay/AA, leather seats, upgraded stereo, power passenger seat, BLIS, built-in garage door opener, etc.

http://hondanews.com/acura-automobiles/releases/2019-acura-ilx-arrives-with-dynamic-new-styling-major-technology-upgrades-and-new-a-spec-treatment

Since the ILX weighs almost 500 pounds less than the TLX, but has almost the same engine and transmission, it is faster. I guess it's kind of a luxury Civic Si with an 8-speed dual clutch transmission....

Nothing that I see in the press release says anything about enhanced driving dynamics, so that's probably very close to the way it was before."
13,1:39AM,stickguy,"that is a pretty steep price cut. Wonder if they will eventually have big lease incentives on them!

14,1:51AM,benjaminhf,"stickguy said:

My guess is that they are hoping to cut the lease incentive. But that means the monthly payments will probably be about the same as with the 2018s—c. $200 a month+ taxes and so on with c.$2500 das. In other words, only c.$30 a month and c.$500 more das than a lease on a Civic LX. But that's the best case scenario for the base model. The ILX Premium would obviously be a bit more...."
15,1:58AM,stickguy,"probably going to be some good deals on the handful of leftover 2018s soon. Though at least near me, not all that many to pick from and mostly base models.
2018 Hyundai Elantra Sport (mine), and 2013 Acura RDX AWD (wife's)"
16,2:03AM,benjaminhf,"Currently there seems to be a $5000+ lease incentive on the last of the 2018 ILXs. But if you wait just a few months you can probably get almost as good a deal on one of the 2019s. Sedans just aren't selling, as you know, and so it's a buyer's market. I bet your local Acura dealer would give you top dollar for your Elantra Sport if you're willing to walk away. But imho the TLX is really the better car. I'd take a base TLX with the 4-wheel steering, slightly more room, etc., etc. over a loaded ILX. If you are considering the ILX, the new style will almost certainly have better resale value."
17,2:08AM,stickguy,"I would have to drive them back to back. I do find the ILX to be a better size for normal driving, though the extra room is nice when travelling, and the wife prefers a bigger car. So a TLX would be OK. no bigger than the Sonata I had was.

but I am not giving up goodies to get the bigger model. so would be comparing an ILX premium vs. a TLX tech.
2018 Hyundai Elantra Sport (mine), and 2013 Acura RDX AWD (wife's)"
18,2:16AM,benjaminhf,"By the end of December I bet they will already be dealing on the 2019 ILXs. The ILX premium with the restyle and the $3.5k price cut is a good msrp. If you can get a good lease incentive of c.3k or so on top of that it should be a nice price/payment overall. The trick is the resale on your Elantra Sport. As you know, once I said I couldn't afford the TLX and it was clear I was willing to walk away, the trade-in offer on my 2016 Accord suddenly increased by quite a bit. I think you might get more from an Acura dealer for the Elantra Sport than from Carvana, esp. if you go in at the end of the sales period (end of Dec.?). They mentioned to me a few times that mine was one of the sales that put them over the top for their sales goal which helped them get a bit of a bonus from corporate."

Again, the local dealer are hopeless at best(What can I do to put ya in a car today, pal?)- and with the well know Hyundai proclivity to void warranties at the drop of a hat I could see problems with using it as my instructor car.
I just had a former Ford service advisor come to work for me in another industry. The subject of warranties came up, and he mentioned how Ford Focus RS owner's would come to him after obviously ""abusing"" their launch control button. IT was funny because his attitude wasn't like mine, which is ""why put a button or feature if the car can't handle it?"" His attitude was more like, the launch control is just for marketing, and you really shouldn't be using it if you wanted warranty covered.

I simply mentioned how Audi didn't really care, at least at the dealers I'd been too, and he admitted he's heard Ford is more ""stuck up"" than others, and heard/noticed that Honda will cover just about anything. He's a young guy so I'm sure he was just taking orders and instruction/training from more Senior Ford officials.

This confirms the stories you've heard about Ford voiding any reasonable honor of warranty.

If only it was a $60,000+ car.  MSRP was $78,475 but with fleet discounts, I paid $67,400 + tax, tags and fees.

Alas, I have no covered parking for my child  .  But I do keep it detailed every 6 months with an additive that has a sunscreen included.

Yeah, like you're really going to keep a car for six months.....

Coffee. I have a couple of good old fashioned percolators. They're great and cheap. Coffee can vary. Frequently Costco has either Gevalia or Dunkin' Donuts coffee. 8 o'clock is nice. I'm of the old school of coffee. ""what flavor would you like?"" ""Coffee flavored."" About a cup and half (well, mug actually) in the morning.

And now, for your entertainment we present insurance mathematics.

As you know my Miata had a mishap back in late October. The Miata seems to be about crashworthy as a Smart. Do not hit a dog. The dog will win.

Anyway, the insurance company has me take it to the body shop twice. Original estimate $3,900. Then they say the shop says to bring it back, there might be hidden damage behind the front bumper cover. Of course they find enough to kick it up to $5,015. Cash value of the car $6,250 (I'll be fine with that figure). Well, since the repair is more than 80% of the cash value they total it. I say fine, I'll keep it and figure it from there. Talk them into splitting the salvage value.so we get:

$6,250 Cash value of car.
+$437.50 sales tax
-$202.50 (half salvage value)
-$500 deductible
_______________
$5,985.00

They send me a check. So instead of just paying the body shop $5,015 they pay me just short of 6 grand. I imagine this is how the government works.

Body shop did a fantastic job. Insurance company sends a guy out to see if it was all well which it is so Friday maybe I call the insurance company to tell them they can put the comprehensive and collision back on the car and I can drive it without fear.

Info is correct. They came ""back"" with the 2010 restyle. My 2011 had them. Before that, I didn't remember seeing them since the 60s and the Cougar is the one that seemed the most popular at the time. I had the same question as you about that strange comment in the quote. Only thing I can think of is maybe on the old Cougars and T-Birds, the sequential thing also happened when the brakes were applied? I can't remember.

I like the attitude that this downturn is a buying opportunity. And, I saw a clever add which said usually when things go on sale you buy them, but, people don't buy stocks when they are on sale.

When markets are like this I hope there is cash in the account and our advisers are buying. And it I didn't have advisers good index funds outperform most brokers. I know people who bought into gold and lost big time, and people who kept buying oil thinking it could only go up. A good index fund generally rises because the market rises over time.....but individual stocks and market sectors can change on a dime, examples, oil, gold, VW, Chipotle............

51,January 2016,driver100,"I got two insurance questions.
1) If I get a stone chip in my windshield will insurance pay for that - less deductible? Will it affect my insurance rates?

2)What amount of liability coverage makes sense? In Canada $1million is normal, some people are getting $3million because you could hit a bus or something and injure or kill a number of people.

In Florida they said $300k was the most they would sell, because they can't take away your house and most people would have less than that in savings. I think they also insinuated awards rarely exceed $300k. We got $1 million 3 years ago because that is what we are used to....this year our insurance company said the max is $300k, but they will give us $1 million as we are grandfathered in.

No coffee maker is immune to bacteria or molds. Re: Keurig and micro-organisms, this is a quote from Snopes on it:

""Nothing about Keurigs or any other food or beverage device makes them immune from day-to-day grime-collecting, and anything that dispenses consumable food or drink should be regularly examined for signs of grubbiness. Mold growth is not exclusive to the Keurig; and while the water reservoir is a larger cleaning chore, checking regularly will lessen mold and bacteria problems. As the quoted portion above suggested, visible mold in any coffeemaker is a strong signal it needs to be cleaned.

It has an almost white interior as well. Much cooler, however I will have to have the interior detailed more frequently due to the white leather. The interior dash, upper side panels, roof liner and carpeting are black - but the door panels where the stereo speakers are and arm rests and center console are all stitched white leather with dark gray stitching.

Many decades earlier, when McNary, AZ, was still in operation (Southwest Forest Industries), it was also interesting to tour the mill town and note what cars were in front of the very modest dwellings.

Don't quite agree. The value of gold will NEVER fall to zero unlike other financial assets or real estate. Gold is a unique and versatile product, almost 75% of the gold ever mined is still around today. It can be used as jewelry, art, industrial applications and can even be eaten.

Wife's year old Mustang got hit in the Target parking lot a couple of days before Christmas (no note...Merry Christmas to me!). I dropped it off for repairs today and picked up a rental, a 2015 Altima 3.5 SL. First impressions - what a great engine crying out for a proper transmission. I can't understand Nissan's obsession with CVTs. I'm sure part of it is me not being used to them, but the car just doesn't drive ""right."" The power is immediate and seemingly always on tap, but the tranny lurches, whines and drones. When sitting still, the engine is smooth as silk.

Other than that, nice ride. I still prefer my daughter's Optima Turbo in terms of looks, handling, features, trans and interior quality. Ride is about equal. Altima has the edge with less road noise and better stereo quality and touchscreen IMO.

2018 Mercedes S450"
113,January 2016,tyguy,"Last week I took a 2016 Mazda6 i Touring with a manual transmission for a test drive. Gorgeous interior that reminds me of premium level design and materials, better than BMW but not quite Audi. Last night I had the internet sales manager, the floor sales manager, and the general manager from the dealership all independently contact me by email and voicemail wanting to close a deal that day. Apparently they had a year-end goal with Mazda to meet and they were still 2 cars short.

Calling them after work, about 7 in the evening, the floor sales manager answered and was ready to work a deal right then and there. He immediately discounted the one manual transmission Mazda6 they had in stock $2,000 below invoice and then researched NADA trade-in on my Impreza.

One challenge with a purchase is that I had not intended to buy brand new, which I explained during the test drive last week. Almost no one wants a manual transmission in the USA when not paired to a sports car. I've noticed that 2016 Mazda6 models with 5,000 miles popping up on the used market, and they move very slowly when equipped with manual transmissions. That leaves me room to negotiate both my trade, a highly desirable model in the Colorado area, for a model that won't move off a dealer's lot.

The other challenge was the new model the dealer had in stock was black paint, which is a non-starter for me. They could try to pull one from another lot, but there was little time to act and they were running into website search problems.

In the end we didn't work a deal and I was okay with that. There's a 5,000-mile used Mazda6 in pearl white paint in Denver at a Subaru dealer, of all places, so I may reach out to them this week. I'm in no hurry. The longer I wait the more 2016s will hit the dealer lots, and they'll depreciate faster than than the Impreza being newer.

There's something fun about buying a company you know and watching it over the years though. We did that with Hershey in the 90s; buy and sell some of it occasionally but mostly sit on it. It's mostly play money, always throws off a dividend and you can justify eating candy since it helps your portfolio.

118,January 2016,abacomike,"Interesting exchange I witnessed between a new car buyer and the used car manager at my dealership this morning.

I had to drop off some papers at my dealer this morning - while I was waiting to get into the office, I was sitting in the guest lounge and heard an argument between a customer and the used car manager about the value of a 2011 Lexus ES350 trade vehicle.  The customer contended that he paid $2000 to have his custom vinyl roof installed when he bought his car and was insistent that his car was worth at least $1500 more because of his investment in the vinyl roof.  The used car manager told the customer that he had to deduct $1500 from the value of his trade because his vinyl roof negatively affected the resale vale of his ES350.  The manager said, ""...I can't sell a car with a vinyl roof - no one wants to buy a car with a custom coach roof - I will have to wholesale the car!""

The customer, in his gruff European accent, said that all his friends and neighbor's have cars with vinyl roofs.  The manager responded that he should try selling his car to one of his vinyl roof loving friends or neighbor's?  The customer said he tried but no one wanted to pay him what he wanted for his car.  

The arguing went on for some time until I had to leave.

BTW, I agreed 100% with the used car manager.  He will have to wholesale that car - no one over in that area is going to buy a late model used car with a vinyl ""hat""!

119,January 2016,nyccarguy,"Thank-you everyone for your honesty and candor. I asked you all because I have a tremendous amount of respect for all of you. I've got a ROTH IRA that I plan on making contributions to for 2015, 2016, & beyond. My wife has a traditional IRA (from an old job) as well as a 403b (she works at a hospital) which she contributes to. I really like a few of the ideas that have to do with balancing & rebalancing every year. I've got a nice chunk of change coming ""off the books"" in May when we are finished paying off the Pilot (I'll call it $700 per month), plus the $200 per month I've been saving with my Subaru (vs. from the 328xi), & the $827 per month I'm saving from refinancing our house back in March. I don't want to even try to ""time the market"" as @cdnpinhead said. I don't have a 401K from my job.

@houdini - I've got a weakness for cars too. I'm trying to ""kick the habit."" It is easy for now since there is nothing out there that I am absolutely going gaga for . I know cars are not cheap. That's part of the big reason I picked the Legacy. It has everything I need (AWD, Automatic, Heated Seats) & nothing I don't (no sunroof, no leather). It is affordable and should last me as long as I want it to (my 9 year old commented the other day that he'd like that to be his 1st car).

@graphicguy - I know real estate is ""where it's at."" Steady appreciation as well as steady income once the property is paid off. I just feel like the price of entry is very high to begin with & I'd have to tie everything extra I have into a rental property. My Grandfather sold buildings back in the '70s & '80s for $1 that are worth MILLIONS today!

Why is it so hard for people to accept that their property is only worth what the market will pay for it. A lot of banks couldn't grasp this concept either when they were trying to sell foreclosed properties on the free market. I n part, it was this faulty mentality that made the recent economic downfall even worse. It seemed GM had a hard time accepting what their assets were really worth too.

121,January 2016,abacomike,"20-25 years ago, a car without a vinyl roof would be worth less than one with a vinyl roof.  It's amazing how trends change over time.  In the 60's and 70's, a car with a 6 cylinder engine was worth less than a car with an 8 cylinder engine.  Now, inline 6's and V6's have turbos that deliver outstanding torque and horsepower.  4 cylinder engines are now very popular and deliver very competent power.

I was thinking about that guy with the ES350 and the vinyl roof - can you imagine him buying a C or E Class Mercedes with a vinyl roof?  Good grief - I shudder at the thought!  
2018 Mercedes S450"
122,January 2016,berri,"NY - I think you got a lot of good advice. Don't know where you are at exactly dollar wise, but a S&P 500 fund or ETF is a good place to center it all on. Then as you expand you may want to add some midcap, small and international ones (S&P 500 probably gives you a 20-25% exposure to international because it includes many large US multinational companies, but there are some good foreign companies as well). The Extended market gives you midcap and small, or you can just use a total market index if you don't want more emphasis in a particular area. Long term I've always liked a little more midcap. There is also the question of growth or value funds, but both are covered in a broad index vehicle. You can always supplement index funds or ETF with a focused one if you want. For example, if you like value, Oakmark Select is a decent one among others. T Rowe Price has a good selection of specialized funds like tech or health care, etc. However, these funds tend to swing in value more and can spin off more taxable distributions in a given year unless you are using an IRA type vehicle because of their often more frequent holdings turnover.

As for individual stocks, it takes a fair amount of money to build up a diversified portfolio versus fund/ETF investing, but you do then control it. Ford v. Toyota - auto stocks are cyclical and right now cars seem to be in a peak selling mode.

One last issue - taxes. Outside of retirement funds, funds spin off distributions each year that are taxable. Index funds tend to spin off fewer than managed funds. So you need to consider whether you'd rather take more tax distribution currently, or defer more until you sell the fund. Over a long term, an index fund can build up a large tax liability (unless you don't need the money and it is bequeathed). Of course you can manage some of this by balancing your index funds every so often by selling and investing it in a different index. Retirement can bring another issue; if it's not Roth you pay back the tax deferral two ways. First minimum mandatory distributions after 70 and second all capital gains in the account are taxed at ordinary income rates. Also, those distributions after you are Medicare eligible can jack up your monthly Medicare premiums in retirement, as well as lead to a higher tax bracket.

Your write-up sounds like you are into rental income. This may reduce your need for fixed income funds (bonds, REIT's, etc.) in your portfolio mix, but you may still want some for investment balance.

Good luck!"
123,January 2016,iluvmysephia1,"tyguy - let us know how it goes pursuing the Mazda 6. I still like the Scion iA, basically a Mazda 2 sedan with the gaping schnozz up front from Scion. I have decided that I like it - weird looking front and all. Mountain States Scion has a red one (Scion calls it Pulse) with the 6-speed stick selling for $15,711. I keep watching from the shadows but won't pounce on one - unless I get a really intense hankering. We owe about $11,100 on our '11 Kia Soul and the car has only 59,115 miles on it. Might be $1,000 or so upside down on our loan.

So I think a deal could be made - it's just dealing with someone who doesn't drive or understand enjoying driving that I have to deal with. She sees things entirely from a financial standpoint, and, I can't entirely knock that. I just think there's a little wiggle room and I plan on working another 5 1/2 years until I retire, so a car payment won't hurt us for that duration - we're already in a loan on our Kia Soul that has 4 years left to pay on. So I look on from the cheap seats and think about it. I do enjoy driving the Kia Soul a lot, too, so it's not that I detest what I currently drive.

well, that isn't what you asked now, is it?

Stock market is a crap shoot, and more research is better. I do happen to believe that for most small investors, they are better off investing on a regular basic is low cost index funds. But, not to say you can't invest some in carefully selected stocks. Just not if you plan to start trading frequently. And do the stocks with the ""spare"" money.

one thing I do like to see is the dividend yield. Surprised that Ford is that high. Just have to trust that they will keep paying it! That way you can somewhat ignore the daily ups and downs of the share price (since you are holding LT), and get a much better return than a money market fund returns. GE has always been good for that, even when their share price was down.

also, if you buy to hold, sign up for dividend reinvestment. Excellent way to build up your shares, and take advantage of dollar cost averaging.

""blue chips"" kind of fell out of favor during the tech speculation booms. Certainly exciting to buy some stock of a company you don't have any idea what they do and watch it shoot up. Though just as likely it crashed and burned. And rarely if ever paid a dividend.

I've concluded no investment adviser, be they a broker, banker or a candle stick maker, knows any more than I do, with information I can find as easily as they can.

I've lost and made a fortune in the stock market, at least on paper (right now, I'm on the plus side of the ledger). I know I've made a fortune for at least one broker with my trades. I've hit some homeruns (still have a nice pile of Apple Stock I bought in 1985). But, I know the tech industry. At the time, Apple wasn't a big risk (even though IBM and PC clones were kicking Apple's behind). I thought I had studied and learned all about the oil industry. Bought a dog I still own (Valero). If I could ever get back to even on it, I'd dump it so fast my etrade account would combust.

Want an iron clad investment vehicle? Real estate. Aside from the blip in '07-'08 (when the entire economy went to hell in a hand basket because of some unscrupulous lenders), real estate will always be worth something.

Automotive companies are not good investments for a novice. Their stocks tend to be volatile, markets often overreact to news, good or bad, especially bad. They are vulnerable to many things not in their control, from economic cycles, to currency, to commodity, to credit cycles (interest rates affect both their capital needs and their customer's ability to purchase), to regulations (emission, safety recalls). It's a tough business overall. You can win a lot or lose a lot and it's hard to predict, where the next skeleton is hidden.

For a novice investor, as a first purchase, I would recommend something less economically sensitive, like consummer staples (PG, JNJ, CL), or perhaps a diversified industrial, especially one supplying aerospace and/or proprietary chemical (HON, UTX, MMM, GE). They are less volatile, especially the former, easier to understand, except perhaps GE. Over time, if you feel more adventurous, next move would be disruptors/secular growth companies, also very volatile, but with much higher reward potential.

163,January 2016,dino001,"BTW, PE ratio is essentially useless for cyclical companies. As a look back, it shows what happened, so when a cycle turns it will show low value (""cheap"") based on earnings that are not going to be repeated (going lower) and will turn very high (""expensive"") just when the earnings are about to improve. One could use ""forward"" PE, but those are also notoriously unreliable for cyclical companies, as analyst are always behind the curve in their estimates. There is also ""normalized"" PE, based on some averaged cycle value, but good luck with finding that one.

If that's the case for you, I'd recommend keeping your company stock at or below 5% of your total portfolio. Enron illustrated what happens if you have it all in company stock and the company goes bust.

I put 110 minus my age in stocks (index funds mostly) and the balance in money markets or bonds -- presently I'm at 43% equities and 57% MM & bonds. The older you get, the less time you've got to make up what could be lost in the market.

I have a mix of funds varying from somewhat volatile (growth, international, health sector) to more conservative (S&P 500). Bond and money market funds are the balance.

Once you decide what percentage you want in each of these areas, rebalance a minimum of once a year -- let the winners pay the losers. This takes discipline, but pays big dividends over the long run. I got through 2001 and 2008 in much better shape than the people who ""let it ride."" Plus you're not trying to time the market. Through last July, when I last rebalanced, my overall 10-year return was 6.5% and 3-year was 8.8%. Not earth shattering, but comfortably ahead of inflation.

A 401K is an excellent vehicle, especially if you get a company match up to some percentage, but it's also a good idea to have a reasonable amount in Vanguard (lowest fees in the business) funds using money that's already been taxed to cover household breakdowns, new cars and the like.

GG, good comparison and review. Sounds like the car you expected to buy when you bought originally bought it. Now, what are your plans going forward?
Driver....BWIA....I don't know what I'm going to do. On the one hand, I'm still pretty PO'd about how I was treated by Cadillac. On the other, if I try to trade this CTS, it will certainly cost me money.

I had some time off last week and again this week. Just curious what the '16 CTS would bring on the trade market, so shopped it at the local BMW dealer. Sort of liked an X5, but really don't need an SUV. Tested a 535i, and was generally underwhelmed.

Keep seeing commercials for the Lexus ""December to Remember"", so probably will take a look at the IS350 F Sport, or even the GS350 F Sport today. I might even head over to the Benz dealer and take another look at the C or E.

Biggest problem I see right now, the '16 CTS is too new, and early in the model year. It's immediately going to raise some suspicions on a used lot. And, with the typical GM discounts, the other dealers don't know how to price it. I could sell it myself, but I'm going to run into the same issue that a dealer might.....""why are you selling it so soon""?

Nobody is going to care about the last several months and what Caddy put me through.

Still, this CTS is now into it's 3rd model year, and I still get compliments on it (not that it matters to me).

If I fall in love with something else, and the dealer is at least reasonable, I might pull the trigger. We'll see how motivated they are for an end of year sale.

I suggest drawing a line in the sand, say, 2 warranty issues and that's considered a strike-out. If you never have a warranty issue, then keeping it until the warranty runs out makes sense.

Not too far into MY 2010 the '11s were introduced, complete with the Coyote engine and legendary ""5.0"" fender emblems where ""GT"" used to be.
Yes, I looked at a 2010 GT in 2011 - a dealer demo. Seemed like a screaming deal but then I understood why once I drove a 2011. I liked it - Grabber Blue with Stone leather, but wasn't going to buy it once I realized the HP deficit.

This just in this morning:

One thing that was common pretty much among all vehicle segments was that the value of diesel & gasoline versions of the same vehicle merged significantly during the year. How much of that can be attributed to low fuel prices and how much to spillover from the VW/Audi diesel situation is questionable, but the fact that their values have merged is not. A Mercedes ML 350 gas and diesel that began the year with about a $2500 premium for the diesel ended the year with only about a $500 difference. A similar situation applies to most gas & diesel versions of the same vehicle regardless of segment.

Most heavily influenced by the low cost of fuel were, as to be expected, the fuel sippers: electric vehicles, compacts, and sub-compacts. Though compacts and sub-compacts were impacted a bit more than usual, it was the very small largely electric (plug-in) segment that really suffered. Vehicles like the Toyota Prius experienced around 20% depreciation during the year. Cars like the Nissan Leaf and Chevy Volt endured more like 30%-40% depreciation in 2015. A Leaf that entered the year with a trade-in value of $10,100 exited it with a value of $6300. That's a huge hit. The Volt lost about 30% of its value: $14,900 vs. $10,500.

So, what do you say now - ""you kids get off my internet!""

It's never fair to generalize but I've seen some pretty clueless 20 something leave carts block the handicapped spot that they just illegally parked in. I frequently run my cart back to the store so some poor kid doesn't have to wrestle with another one. My wife, who has some trouble walking refuses to get a handicap tag because she wants to give the space to ""really"" handicapped people.

Then you see a fit young person just leave a cart to block a space or roll into another car as they yack on the phone.

Misuse of handicapped parking spaces AND permits is a favorite topic of mine. Our city police have a parking enforcement car that specializes in looking for cars without a handicapped parking tag. Watched one get a ticket at Kroger yesterday.

But they need to be more CSI like on the people who have tags that aren't theirs. I watched 3 early 20s girls gingerly climb out of a compact car with their handicapped tag hanging on the mirror. All 3 were perfectly healthy except that they needed to eat about half as much and walk a couple miles a day for a year to lose extra poundage. They needed a 200 foot walk from a regular parking spot to the door at Kroger. Instead they had a stolen or leftover parking tag from grandma.

Did have a case where the local police challenged a lady in a car with handicapped tag at Walmart. She said it was her mother's who was in the store. Lady apparently gave a lot of mouth to the policeman; she was from a more urban city adjacent to ours. Policeman out waited her at perimeter of parking area in outlying businesses, and when she left, alone, he stopped her and gave her a citation for several things. No mother in the car. LOL

He politely explained...  Well if cancer isn't a handicap I don't know what is.  I was only 12 years old but I can remember the mortified look on her face like it was yesterday.  

Moral of the story.  People who use handicap spots without needing them are scum, but you have to be careful. 

FWIW my Grandfather had a handicapped tag and whenever I would drive him in his car I would drop him off at the door and park in a normal spot.  He walked even less and it kept a spot open for someone who needs it.

That's the way it should work.

Another problem with Ohio's hanging placards is that they don't expire for 5 years or something like that. So 'leftover' cards are fair game for family members when someone moves to nursing home or passes away. Time validation is by a hole punched in a month column and year date code column. Since all the hanger cards have been blue with white letters for a long time; they need to change them. I noticed the officer who gave the ticket at Kroger was slowly going past the cars with mirror hangers. I suspect she was looking for the hole in the year column to verify they weren't expired.

I've seen young healthy 'kids' looking like high school or barely twenty in age with placards hanging on the mirror use the handicapped spaces. That's been several years ago, however. There was a time where stealing the cards was frequent because people left their windows down or their cars unlocked with the cards hanging on mirror or lying on the dash.

Handicap parking originally was intended for wheelchair users in handicap conversion vehicles. Fair enough, makes sense. But then every senior with a creaky knee who had enough cojones to ask their doctor to sign a form got one. The eligibility criteria are ignored and largely not understood, here at least. I have long thought that the criteria should be dramatically tightened to include only those who need mobility assistance.

Not satisfied with having blue handicap spots near their entrance sitting unused, more recently, as most everyone knows, a lot of retailers have added other special spots over the year. I have seen mommy spots, seniors spots, hybrid vehicle spots... maybe others I missed too. Since those have no designation in law they can be used and the provision ignored, if you are brave enough.

Yes, their wood is all low bid stuff. You have to go through a whole pallet to find a few good pieces. My business also competes with Walmart & Home Depot garden centers. They can import finished goods from Canada cheaper than I can buy the raw materials thanks to exchange rates.

Here in the States they seem to mandate too few. Then stores like Walmart don't maximize the area for HC parking to get in the most spaces by using diagonal parking for part of them. Instead they have lots of van
spaces as parallel parking with lots of space around for wheelchair access to the vans. Seldom used for handicapped wheelchairs. Instead a regular vehicle is parked there surrounded by enough space for 2 more 4-wheelers.

In cities and large towns WalMart faces competition from large national corporations who have the buying power to keep their costs down and play WalMarts game. In little towns it's all mom and pop establishments that don't have those advantages and WalMart can easily bury them.

In cities and large towns WalMart faces competition from large national corporations who have the buying power to keep their costs down and play WalMarts game. In little towns it's all mom and pop establishments that don't have those advantages and WalMart can easily bury them.


I have heard this WalMart argument for years....WalMart moves in and shuts down the smaller competition because people prefer to shop at WalMart. At the end of the day, it's the customers who decide they'd rather buy from WalMart than from their hometown stores they've been supporting for years. Don't want a WalMart? Don't shop there and continue supporting the local stores.

Don't rail on the Waltons because you won't suppor your local merchants. WalMart is just practicing capitalism!

I am not railing on anyone, just stating why Walmarts competition suffers in small rural areas and not in larger population centers. Small rural towns are serviced mostly by mom and pop shops that cannot match Walmarts prices. In larger population centers where national chains are at they face competition that can match their prices hence they can survive, be it good bad or indifferent that is the economic reality.

Doing business with Walmart takes huge infrastructure (I have first hand experience) and they make their vendors do everything to make their own operation (warehouse, shipping, etc) as efficient as possible.  All of this is done to minimize overhead and keep prices as low as possible for us.  

I don't especially like shopping at Walmart, but they carry almost everything and are priced right so at times it's the best place to get what you need.  I much prefer our local grocery store (Shop Rite) and BJs.

There is nothing wrong with trying to get more for less, or at least getting what you get now for less.

Speaking of getting more for less I was shopping with the wife yesterday and we stopped at the pet department to get snacks for the real boss of the house and I noticed they had bags for Fidos (Phydoughs?) little droppings. One package of 90 for $7.99 and one package of 180 for $16.99.

I usually don't shop at wally world for a few reasons. First and foremost there are perfectly good places to shop that are closer to me than the nearest wally world where the prices are comparable to wally world. Secondly the few wally worlds I have been to seem to be filthy and seem to be cramped (as if they are trying to get as much merchandise into the store as they can.

Walmart operates similar to large grocery chains like Publix, Winn Dixie, etc., with certain suppliers.  As an example, Coke and Pepsi stock their goods themselves in Walmart - Walmart merely contracts with large suppliers to stock their own products on specified shelves.  The same is true with snacks like Snyders Pretzels, Lays, Doritos, Kellogg's Cereals, Nabisco, etc.  in other words, the suppliers are issued shelving space and it is the responsibility of the supplier to stock those assigned shelves at agreed upon pricing.

Walmart branded items are different.  The house label is GREAT VALUE.  Great Value items are supplied by jobbers who use the brand label but use their generic products.

So, Walmart, in some cases, operates like large grocery store conglamorates because they require suppliers to maintain their product supplies on designated shelving - like Kraft, Hebrew National, Sorrento Cheeses, etc,  Walmart negotiated the wholesale pricing agreements with the suppliers.

Yes Great Value is the house brand as is Mainstays and a few other propriety lines.  Target has Archer Farms as their house brand.  In retail today you have to have margin increasing proprietary brands.

A 4.5 is a fairly good sized trembler, especially for that area.  They claim that this phenomenon began with ""fracking"" for oil in old wells.  Good grief - if these quakes can be directly linked to fracking, they really need to put a stop to it in that area.  Fracking creates fissures that loosen underground structural integrity.

I had cataract surgery when I was about 52 (don't remember exactly). I spend a lot of time in the sun.

The Dr. said for someone that young there is a possibility of scarring since it may heal too quickly and they may have to go back in with a laser to remove the scar tissue. (I didn't ""get it"", but that's what he said). I didn't have any problems with either eye.

Anyway...they did one and then the other a few weeks later. I went from 20-400 in the first eye to 20-15 20 minutes later. No regrets.

I would guess a lot of the experience you receive depends on the individual store or regional manager. Up here, I have started going to Walmart over the last year or so for certain things where they are much less expensive than the other retailers in town. You have to limit yourself to those things because they are not cheaper on everything nor is the quality always the same. At the store I use, I've returned things a couple of times and they were great, quick and easy, no questions asked.

Target made an ill-advised incursion into the Canadian market a few years ago and it was a total disaster from day one. People familiar with both said that while the stores physically looked similar to their US stores, the products and pricing were very different. Poor assortment, high prices, and lots of supply chain issues leading to empty shelves. It was as if they had never run a retail store chain before and did not have a clue. After losing billions they pulled out after less than 2 years. Unreal.

Of the top 10 scams, I received phone calls from two of them this year:

One involves a threatening phone call from the IRS stating that I was being taken to court for $18,000 in back taxes I owed.  Of course, my response to the fake IRS agent was, ""...I guess I'll see you in court!""  He hung up
When I do taxes I always tell my clients that the IRS will never call them, the IRS always contacts them through the mail, and when they do get contacted to contact us as soon as they can. I have had some tell me that they have received calls from people say that they were from the IRS.

The second is more and more younger people are choosing to live in denser urban areas with better mass transit and don't need cars.

Just got home from taking my neighbors to dinner.  They were so nice to me after I got home from the hospital and went shopping for me, I thought I would treat them to a steak dinner.

When the check came and I took a good look at it, I asked the neighbors if they knew how to wash dishes.  All kidding aside, the 3 of us racked up a bill of $311.00.  I left a $60.00 tip and began to think - I had a surf and turf, so did the husband.  The wife had a petit filet and they shared a Caesar salad.  They ordered sautéed mushrooms and chef fries and each of them had a drink.  I did not have any sides or alcoholic beverages.  They shared a large piece of cheesecake.  Each had a cappuccino.

They sure could pack it away.  But $371.00 for dinner - that's almost the price of an HDTV at BestBuy.  I didn't think I knew anyone well enough to spend that much money on dinner for 3 - and all I had was a main course and iced tea.  Next time, it's Chick-Fil-A or McDonalds!  
Once I paid more than that for just me and the wife on our tenth anniversary. It was at the signature room at the top of the John Hancock building, but man what a view.

The oil money has dried up in Alaska too and the state is planning to re-introduce an income tax after a 35 year absence.

What's really bizarre is the State's decision to levy an income tax while continuing to send out dividend checks for  up to  $8,000 per resident  (or household, I'm not sure)

I was up in Alaska the first year they had the dividend, most of the people I knew blew the money on stuff VHS equipment.

My favorite meal memory happened on a road trip in '99 (?) on Gaspé Bay.

We knew it was going to be special when the locals started arriving and each would discuss the night's entrees with the owner for several minutes and when the starter plate of limpets and periwinkles plate was set before us, we were in hog heaven.

I was in New Orleans back in the 1980's for a conference with another school principal. We were staying at the Marriott New Orleans on the corner of Royal and Canal on the 60th floor.  We had made reservations for dinner on the top floor with a view of the Mississippi River and the city.  We were sitting at the bar waiting for our table to be made ready when I got an elbow in my ribs from the guy sitting next to me.  He mistook me for my twin brother and bought us a round of drinks.  We invited him to join us at the table for dinner.  The final tab with drinks and dessert was $650.00 for the 3 of us.  This friend of my brother's put the whole bill on his American Express Business Card.

Especially with expensive whisky, that is the way to go. I almost always enjoy it more with just a bit of water rather than neat but try it both ways.

Last night I had 3 small drams of different whiskies: Highland Park 25, which was incredible but almost too densely flavored neat; with water it was incredible. Then a Macallan Elegancia I forgot I had, which I really liked. I hadn't had it for years and did not remember it at all. Nutty flavor. Then at the end of the night I had a little bit of Lagavulin 16 which is a unique whisky, very peaty and strongly flavored, not for everyone but simply a great whisky. With a little water it is wonderful.

You mentioned Ruth's Chris. IMO they are a bit overrated now. There are other ""upscale"" steak houses that do it better.

Since we are talking Steak Houses, the best I've ever been to is Keen's in NYC. It's been there forever and is nothing short of amazing, however you will certainly pay for the experience.

Delfriscos, and Mortons are always good choices as well.
I agree. We have two local high end steak places that I rate better. One, close to where I live called JAGS. The other is based in Cincinnati, but has restaurants in other cities. It's Jeff Ruby's.

REgarding energy, wind, solar, electric, etc are growing exponentially. I was speaking to a TX based energy company a few weeks ago. Their execs don't believe there will be a bounce back in oil, and are planning to ""right size"" in 2016 as a result.

Odd thing - the insurance company totaled it and then settled with me for about $800 more than the job cost. This was the body shop that they said to take it to. They're the best around.

This is actually the second time I made money on a crashed car in a year. When my daughter's 04 Camry got clobbered because she was parked at a red light that the guy behind her in an F-150 was too busy to notice. I ask my mechanic about it and he says he knows a guy who does nice work (he does!) for way less. I took the totaled money, by dragging it out they threw in the $600 they were going to withhold as salvage value. They only viewed it as a high mileage 11 year old car. I think of it as one that was owned the entire time by a Toyota mechanic and before that his mother, whose husband is a real gearhead. Other that the initial oil that came with the car it's never seen anything but synthetic.

Maybe I should start crashing cars as a side job...

What I don't get on the Miata is they totaled it based on a lower number and are sending me the check. The body shop, which is a great one, is where they wanted me to go.

Lots of things make sense now knowing that and the doctor said under normal circumstances he's go after them now but I only have the one good eye and while cataract surgery these days is easy and virtually foolproof it's that virtually that is the rub.

The wife's Outback has almost 11,000 miles on it and it goes in for it's second service today. Wanted to confirm with @nyccarguy and @tyguy that it's the AWD differential fluid that I want changed this trip.

Got the car cleaned up inside and out yesterday - the bad weather we've had the past couple of weeks makes cars quite filthy. Shines up like a new penny. No complaints whatsoever after 10 months.
HI Michaell. I recommend changing out the rear differential fluid at 15,000 and then again at 30,000. After that you can go to 30,000-mile intervals. I waited to 30,000 on my Impreza and found the oil very muddy, and wished I had gone with a shorter interval for that first change. Ask for a high quality synthetic. If you do the service yourself, it'll cost about $15. If you have the dealer perform it, then about $90.

The only downside is that the dealer (Groove) has discontinued their loaner car program, so I'm stuck there while the service is being performed. Gives me a chance to walk the lot and see what's out there - and check out the Toyota dealership next door.

I have done a little analysis of the car buyers both on this thread and over on CCBA (I monitor that thread but don't post much).  It seems that there are several types of car buyers:

One type loves to have several cars/trucks in his fleet - and is always looking to add more - a true chronic car buyer and stable owner.

Another type loves to buy new cars - at least one per year - because there is always something coming onto the market that is perceived to be a ""must have""!

Another type buys cars but keeps his cars for several years - usually until the new car warranty is about to expire.  But these types are always looking and are usually defenseless if a car catches their fancy and the deal is too good to ignore.

Then, there's the pre-owned only type - never buys a new car, but is in and out of used cars constantly.  This type loves to tinker with his cars as well.

There are a myriad of types of car buyers, but they usually can comfortably fit into one or more of the above categories.  Where do you fit?  
well, I'm a bit choice A, a little choice B, and ... well, I guess not completely choice C since the ""never buys new"" doesn't fit me, but I have had several that I tinker with, fix up, upgrade, drive for a while, sell off, and buy another to go through the same process.

I love having several cars and would buy more if the space is available. I buy both new and used, depending on the deal. I have kept them as few as 4 months and as long as 4 years (excluding the outlier Alfa Romeo that I kept for 10 years). In other words, if I want one, I can usually come up with an excuse to get it.

Thanks, OF. That one's an excellent color (IMNHO) and has the wire wheels and knockoffs that my grey one did. However, it's some years newer, when they went to three wipers to cover the wide skinny windshield. The array of Smiths instruments, with the dual water temp/oil pressure gauge, is still my benchmark for how an instrument panel is supposed to look. When the U.S. gov't got involved a few years later, the raised suspension and rubber bumpers ruined the looks of the car for all time.

That one's certainly in good shape, but I prefer the SU carbs, now that I've learned much of what there is to know about them. I converted my '73 240Z back to the SUs that they all had up through '72; the '73 EPA-compliant carbs were hopelessly complex in comparison, as I've heard Webers are. The speakers were set up just the way I did mine, with the 8-inchers in the trunk.

God, I loved that car."

The surf and turf (8 oz filet and a huge lobster tail) were $81.00 each.  The 8 oz filet was $45.00.  The beer and wine were $8.00 each.  The mushrooms and chef fries were $13.00 each.  The Caesar salad was $19,00.  The scallops were $21.00.  The cheesecake was $17.00.  The coffees were $5.00 each and the iced tea was $2.50.

Not a bad price on that MGB actually. They can be very reliable cars once you sort them out, and you can buy any part you need, shipped UPS to your door.

Alaska had an income tax before the oil boom hit and should have kept it. Lots of carpetbaggers have worked there over the decades and flew straight back to the Lower 48 with their income on their two weeks off, while using state facilities.

There's also talk of doing a statewide sales tax in addition to or instead the income tax idea. My wife and I collected about $16,500 each over the 20 years we lived there. It's a great economic shot in the arm when the checks come.

Alberta has an oil money ""heritage"" fund too but it was earmarked for government use. I understand a lot of it got wasted with infrastructure boondoggles instead of letting individuals blow it on snowmachines or big screen TVs.

Very, very true. Yesterday we drove home to Colorado thinking the roads would be clear. Nope. They looked clear.

On a straight section I tapped the brakes for a quick road surface check and confirmed my suspicions when the ABS immediately kicked in and traction control went nuts. More ice.

One of my best friends in high school had an MG. Being from a rural area with few foreign cars when people asked her what she drove and she said ""an MG"" they would say ""Oh you mean a GM"" thinking she didn't know her cars.

She loved it but as you note it was a continuous project."

btw....was oldfarmer on that list, multiple cars that make up a diverse fleet?

While I am here, I will post one observation I made today. When I leave the compound...our semi-gated community (gate but no guard) I come to a stop sign. Then I wanted to turn left onto a somewhat busy street, that has a curve to the left and to the right. When it was clear I drove out and went left. Of course, by the time you actually go out a car is coming from the right. Like my wife said at the time, that's the time you really appreciate that extra horsepower. When we entered I-75 I needed the 330 horses (and when entering I go into SPORT MODE) again to stay ahead of the big heard of cars in the right lane.

I am a firm believer that horsepower can give you a big safety advantage if used wisely.

No question about it.  Gear ratios also help. The 330 hp twin turbo is like ""THE MOUSE THAT ROARED""!  Quiet while idling or cruising at 65 mph, but when you kick that sucker down and those turbos kick in, it's like a V8.  The outstanding 354 lb ft of torque also makes a tremendous difference.

I've got my Prelude - 13 years & 156K - well chosen & very satisfying to drive.  

I've got our Pilot which will be 5 years old in May & paid off.  Currently 72K miles.  It fits the needs of our family of 5 quite well and should have no trouble lasting until it at least crosses the 200K mark.

My Legacy is the youngest car in the fleet.  1 year & 3 months - 24K miles.  Truly everything I need and nothing I don't.  Automatic Transmission (CVT), All Wheel Drive, Heated Cloth Seats, Bluetooth, Backup Camera, 4 doors, big trunk.  It's 175 horsepower H4 engine is merely adequate.  It gets up to speed and doesnt have any trouble keeping up with traffic.  It is comfortable, well screwed together, & I'm maintaining it for the long haul.  I just can't blast out of toll booths or merge onto the highway like the Millenium Falcon with the hyper drive engaged.  It was an affordable vehicle (sticker was $24K & change). Subaru's tend to hold their value well, so I didn't hesitate to take out a 72 month loan which I will pay off way ahead of time.  I'm maintaining it like it is a keeper.  So we shall see.

I have done a little analysis of the car buyers both on this thread and over on CCBA (I monitor that thread but don't post much).  It seems that there are several types of car buyers:

One type loves to have several cars/trucks in his fleet - and is always looking to add more - a true chronic car buyer and stable owner.

Another type loves to buy new cars - at least one per year - because there is always something coming onto the market that is perceived to be a ""must have""!

Another type buys cars but keeps his cars for several years - usually until the new car warranty is about to expire.  But these types are always looking and are usually defenseless if a car catches their fancy and the deal is too good to ignore.

Then, there's the pre-owned only type - never buys a new car, but is in and out of used cars constantly.  This type loves to tinker with his cars as well.

There are a myriad of types of car buyers, but they usually can comfortably fit into one or more of the above categories.  Where do you fit?  
I think I fit into all of those categories. While I usually intend to keep my new cars forever I will consider trading up. My Eclipse was a great car but the Mustang beat it in every way that was important to me. On the other extreme I love seeking out old car bargains as often as possible. While I can resist the urge to throw $40k at the latest new shiney object I am often helpless when something comes along in the sub $3k range.

2017 Cadillac ATS Performance Premium 3.6, 1968 Oldsmobile Cutlass S Holiday Coupe"
438,December 2015,tyguy,"We just returned from a family vacation to Utah that involved a drive from Colorado to the Salt Lake area. We left December 23 while it was sunny and beautiful in Northern Colorado, only to encounter a wind storm raking across Wyoming. What a drive. The Impreza typically averages around 34 mpg at 75 mph while turning 2300 RPM. Well, that trip, I noted on a 5ish percent grade down hill section, the motor was turning 3500 RPM and returning 24 mpg while fighting the brutal headwind. And we were in a low car.

The semi trucks weren't nearly so lucky with their high profiles and dragging trailers. We came across four of them overturned on the opposite east bound lanes, two of which had totally shut down the freeway due to the trailers blocking all regular and emergency lanes.

The wind blew snow across the highway which packed down to 2 inches of solid, shiny ice, and the blowing snow created a white-out effect from the ground to about 3 feet up, so there was no way to see what you were driving on. Only the tall road marker polls kept me oriented to the freeway. Crazy.

The Impreza really was the perfect car for those conditions with an amazingly effective AWD system, solid chassis, decent tires, and slung low to the ground. I was still miserable and white knuckled.

At Rock Springs we noticed the digital freeway signs indicated that I-80 had been closed, but the gates were all still open and traffic continued along. So we kept crawling along with the others, right up until the middle of nowhere, also known as Fort Bridger, Wyoming. Winter population: 1 parking lot full of semi trucks.

As we approached the Fort Bridger exit I noticed a police car with flashing lights parked across the highway lanes, and turned to my wife and asked, ""do you you think he would mind if I just blew by him?"" Well, that question remained unanswered because just as we approached him, he lowered the freeway gates to block all traffic east and west. Bummer. Our Impreza was handling the conditions just fine, but all those semi trucks struggling with the wind and ice became the impetuous for closing the freeway.

So, we exited with the semis and a handful of other cars to find the only thing around was a parking lot on the side of the freeway with howling winds and 7-degree temps not counting the wind chill factor. Not good. We did have a nearly full tank of gas, food, water, and plenty of clothing, so our lives weren't in danger by any means. But, spending an evening in a compact car with three people, a golden retriever, clothing for a week, and Christmas presents after already having spent 7 hours in said car, well, that wasn't a very pleasant thought.

We parked for a moment to get our bearings, and then sent our phones into search and rescue mode. There were two hotels accessible by a side road that branched off from the highway, and we found one to be closed for winter. That left one place left, the Country Cabins Inn in Mountain View, Wyoming. My wife called and found they had vacancy (yeah!!) and they would take our dog (double yeah!!). So, we set out on the icy country road wondering what kind of hotel we'd find in such a remote area.

We pulled into little Mountain View and discovered quite a nice little place. The Country Cabins facility was indeed made up of individual cabins that were new, clean, warm, and comfortable, and featured two very comfortable queen beds. We literally could not have found a better place for our needs. To add to the pleasant surprise was a Chinese restaurant attached to the facility and the owner mentioned they made good food, and he was right. Shortly after thawing out and eating dinner, we found a note in the cabin that stated no pets, so we learned then that the owner had made an exception for us given the circumstances, which we genuinely appreciated. And to top it off, an hour after checking in, the owner stopped by with a Christmas toy for our daughter. What an amazing guy.

The next morning the winds ebbed and the plows added a layer of sand to the ice. The freeway reopened and we then continued our journey to enjoy Christmas Eve as planned with our friends and family. So, a miserable experience was turned heart warming because of the generosity of an individual. It was our own little Christmas story.

For one thing, they raised the body up off of the frame, this achieves two purposes.

One, the drive shaft does not intrude into the cabin (these are front engine / rear wheel drive vehicles, and they have no hump in the middle of the floorboard.)

Two, with the body up higher, the fender wheels take up less of the cargo space in the bed. Which is very important, as most of the trucks they sell these days only have a 5.5' bed.

And, I think they just go after the ""macho"", big truck image.

Just a way out opinion but I like that long hood and shorter trunk. I think it is partly to make room for a straight 6 engine in the bmw, and it makes the car feel more balanced when driving it. Our Passat has a shorter hood but an extra large rear seat and pretty large trunk.

The space inside my MB E400 seems pretty spacious, and the trunk is very large.

I have driven vans and cars that don't have a hood and I don't like the feeling....I feel like I am driving a bus.
Now this is what you call a long hood:




Once I got a rental car and I got upgraded to one of these. You feel on top of the world driving at the time, driving a big Caddie with that huge long hood;



What the heck is that yellow car, a chopped Seville?

As to the bottom red Caddy...been there, done that.

I'm an oddball that in that I'm only 37 and have owned a few MGM's and Town Cars. I love the ride, and comfort these cars give. Ford made that same basic platform last from 1979 - 2011. It really only had two major updates (once in 92, and again in 2003 when they got rack and pinion steering). They are overall very reliable, just powerful enough and came with enough creature comforts to keep people happy.

Ford had no choice but to discontinue them. In order to add the required safety features and bump up FE would have meant major modifcations that I'm sure wouldn't have been profitable in the end.

I currently have an 04 MGM with 99k on the clock. My plans are to keep it a little while longer then replace it with a 2011 Town Car and keep that for a good while. I don't drive enough for the gas mileage to be a problem, and in reality it gets better mileage than our 2015 Enclave anyway.

Funny note, just the other morning I was gassing up at the Wawa close to work and the guy pumping the gas for me (New Jersey's only perk for living here) said they need to make cars like this again ""It's Classy"".... he couldn't have been more than 19.

Another type buys cars but keeps his cars for several years - usually until the new car warranty is about to expire.  But these types are always looking and are usually defenseless if a car catches their fancy and the deal is too good to ignore.

I wouldn't celebrate Boxing Day if I was in Canada so I don't celebrate it here. It is a minor holiday...servants got a gift in a little box after Christmas, so it became known as Boxing Day. I think it is a good holiday as it gives most people a day off after Christmas. But here it is a regular day...drove by a Firestone store and a Good Year store at 7 p,m. Saturday evening and they were still fixing cars. A Walmart Neighborhood Store and Sam's were open Saturday evening....who needs groceries on a Saturday evening.

But, thank you for your good Boxing Day Wishes, it is very thoughtful.

Several years ago we took a vacation to London (England) for Christmas. When we landed on Christmas eve, everything was open. To our dismay, on Christmas day AND Boxing day almost everything was closed. Including the tube (subway to most of us)!!! We were stuck walking around our hotel neighborhood looking for anything to do. I remember watching a showing of the movie Titanic in the hotel TV since there was nothing else for us to do! We lost an extra day of exploring as we had no idea Boxing day was a real holiday in England..... I can't imagine mass transit shutting down for 2 days anywhere in the US (or Canada).

Verizon Telematics, a subsidiary of the biggest US wireless carrier, has launched a new aftermarket telematics vehicle platform that gives drivers detailed information on their car's health and how to get help in the event of an emergency or car trouble.

Dubbed Hum, the $15-a-month service requires drivers to install a small dongle into their car's onboard diagnostic reader (OBD) port. Almost every car made after 1996 has an OBD.

A Bluetooth-enabled device that ships with Hum is clipped to the car's visor and communicates between the Hum dongle and a dedicated Verizon mobile app. Once connected, the platform will diagnose problems with the car and offers the ability to contact nearby roadside, emergency and stolen vehicle assistance, among other features.

If there is a problem, I automatically get a message on my big screen telling me what the problem is and suggested actions.  It's part of my contract with Mbrace.

But quite frankly, IMHO, the more monitoring that goes on the more chance of a glitch or false reading or even a breakdown in telecommunications with the car.  The more junk on a car, the higher chance of garbage in, garbage out.

488,December 2015,graphicguy,"Driver....yeah, taking some time off until the NEWYEAR.

It's hard for me to believe that the '16 CTS is in any way related to the '14 version. Cadillac has done more than a new transmission and updated CUE.

The '16 is faster with a fatter torque/RPM range. I expected the shifting to be different, but not THIS different. 8 speed is smoother and more in tune with the power band of the motor. It's quicker to shift, up or down.

The engine sounds much more refined with a better snarl in the upper rev range. It ""sounds"" more expensive than the '14.

Handling/ride and steering is better and more refined, by a pretty significant margin. Not sure what they did, but it's clear to me that the '14 was either really all wrong, or there's been a very healthy development effort in the steering and suspension dept.

The '16 urges you to push it. The '14 dreaded to be pushed (and gave off moans, groans and steering snafus as a way to protest pushing it).

Apple Car Play makes CUE more functional and 1000% more useable and easier to operate.

In short, pretty significant delta between the '14 and '16.

GG, good comparison and review. Sounds like the car you expected to buy when you bought originally bought it. Now, what are your plans going forward?

Driver....BWIA....I don't know what I'm going to do. On the one hand, I'm still pretty PO'd about how I was treated by Cadillac. On the other, if I try to trade this CTS, it will certainly cost me money.

I had some time off last week and again this week. Just curious what the '16 CTS would bring on the trade market, so shopped it at the local BMW dealer. Sort of liked an X5, but really don't need an SUV. Tested a 535i, and was generally underwhelmed.

Keep seeing commercials for the Lexus ""December to Remember"", so probably will take a look at the IS350 F Sport, or even the GS350 F Sport today. I might even head over to the Benz dealer and take another look at the C or E.

Biggest problem I see right now, the '16 CTS is too new, and early in the model year. It's immediately going to raise some suspicions on a used lot. And, with the typical GM discounts, the other dealers don't know how to price it. I could sell it myself, but I'm going to run into the same issue that a dealer might.....""why are you selling it so soon""?

Nobody is going to care about the last several months and what Caddy put me through.

Still, this CTS is now into it's 3rd model year, and I still get compliments on it (not that it matters to me).

If I fall in love with something else, and the dealer is at least reasonable, I might pull the trigger. We'll see how motivated they are for an end of year sale.

With the 2017 E Class due out in a few months, there are some tremendous incentives on the 2016.  The incentives are also bolstered by additional trunk money.  If you have access to any fleet discounts like Morgan-Stanley, USAA, etc., it could be interesting.

However, you own a 2016 CTS that is performing well above expectations.  If you remember, I suggested driving the CTS for several months before pulling the trigger, which you have and, as a result, you are quite pleased with this car.  Why go from a 2016 luxury car to another 2016 luxury car and have to spend money besides the trade value?  For a 2017, maybe worth it, but not for another 2016.

C300 is a great looking car and a beautiful interior. But, I agree, I don't get those GPS's that stick right up in your line of vision.






Mike has a good idea in trying a 2016 E400. They may give good prices since the 2017s are completely different.

The 2016 Cadillac should get a lot more for it than the 2014 model. First year of depreciation is supposed to be 15%, but that must be if sold privately. 10% a year after, so trading now wouldn't be a huge loss.

The 2016 CTS sounds very good....the problem could be if it needs warranty work done on it....and the issue of trust. We ditched the Audi and I would guess the cost of the repair, about $1200 was less than the depreciation hit we would take if we traded it in today.

I wouldn't celebrate Boxing Day if I was in Canada so I don't celebrate it here. It is a minor holiday...servants got a gift in a little box after Christmas, so it became known as Boxing Day.

When I moved to Chicago from New York on my grant for my MA, I spent my first week there on the 30th floor of Marina City Towers (twin towers in the center of downtown Chicago).  The first 15-20 floors are just parking spaces.  You drive up on the circular drive to your reserved spot and then take an elevator to your residence.

I had a tough time falling asleep because the circular tower would sway back and forth in the strong winds.  How people could get used to that is beyond me!

I really don't recall.  Back in the late 1960's, Marina City Towers was ""THE IN PLACE"" to live in Chicago.  The towers were completed in 1964.  If you Google Marina City, they have a detailed history of its construction and design.  At the time, it was the most expensive place to live in downtown Chicago.  A friend of the family lived there and had two vacant, furnished apartments there, one of which I lived in until I could find a place of my own.  I offered to pay him a few hundred for the week, but he refused.  It was very nice of him.

522,December 2015,abacomike,"For the first time in several days, I felt well enough to drive over to the Casino and have their brunch, which is comped to me. I had a piece of prime rib, some smoked brisket of beef, some shrimp cocktail and 2 pancakes and syrup. That's the most I've eaten in almost four weeks. I didn't have large portions, very small portions in fact. I just don't have the appetite I used to have for food.

For the past 4 weeks, I have been taking 1 low-dose (81 mg) coated aspirin every morning, as directed by my doctors, with the rest of my pills. I've noticed that my stomach has been bothering me for a couple of weeks and it finally dawned on me - I can't take aspirin because it causes horrible stomach problems for me. So I did not take the aspirin this morning. As I guessed, my stomach is much better. I will call the doctor's office tomorrow (two of them are still on vacation somewhere in India or Pakistan) and inform the nurses that I have stopped taking the aspirin. He prescribed a pill for stomach pains every morning, but it is obviously not working. I take two strong pills each day that are blood thinners - Eliquis and Brilinta along with statins and a cholesterol pill. I know they like to prescribe low dose aspirin after a heart attack, but I just can't handle aspirin. I guess I should also put a call into the cardiologist (he's also in India until after the 1st of January) and let the nurses know I cannot handle aspirin. I would think that with all the blood thinners I am on, the aspirin is very redundant. I will find out tomorrow.

I said to him that he probably forgot, but that it was not necessary for him to thank me. considering his difficulties with language.

He said it was unseasonably cold out in the low desert this year. Highs in the upper 50's and low 60's and lows in the 40's. It's usually closer to 70 during the day this time of year out there. But the whole west coast has had a very cold December with the outlook for January similar. He said he was cold, which is saying something since he usually doesn't mind it being cooler in the winter out there.

Here, it's still in the mid 80's during the day and mid to upper 70's at night. We are setting records for not only high temps during the day, but ""highest low temps"" at night. Very interesting winter so far.

I am totally serious about my problems sleeping while living that short time in the Marina City Towers.  It was in January, 1966, during an exceptionally windy couple of days.  The wind was howling from the northeast at about 25-35 mph.  I was in bed and almost ended up on the floor.  I stood up because I was getting seasick and had difficulty maintaining my balance.  It certainly was more than 6 inches in one direction - it was more like a foot in each direction.

Used to be OK with Disney but they changed their handicapped policy so that it's just another fast pass or whatever you call it. Instead of the way it used to be you now have to go where the ride is, get a time, and come back at that time. That and how they are now gearing their prices to millionaires and they're done for me.

I remember in 01 going down to an empty Disney (after 9/11 there was quite a period where people didn't go anywhere. Not this boy). My second oldest was a nut for the Star Wars ride, which normally had long lines. We'd go out and right back in. Had a ball. At one point Jen and the older girls went off to do something so I ended up sitting hanging around with then 6 week old Carrie. Some woman comes up and says, ""your first Grandchild?"" No my latest child. (Claire was still in China.) She felt all embarrassed. I told her not to be. I was certainly old enough to qualify but my kids weren't old enough. Now two of them are but no weddings on the offing. For the second one that is currently a good thing. She has a boyfriend. Nuff said.

I always tell that one that if she ever doubts I love her remember I sat through the Pokemon movie with her in the theater maybe the second day it was out. One of the longer 90 minutes of my life.

My oldest grandson (15 years old) called me yesterday to wish me a Merry Christmas and to thank me for the check I sent him.  As we were talking, I told him how much I loved him and how much I missed him.  I reminisced with him a bit when he was a little boy and the things we did together.  I reminded him that if he ever doubted that I've always loved him, to think back to the almost 2 hours I sat with him in a movie theater so he could see the The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles when he was 7 years old.  He laughed for almost a minute remembering my groans and moans as I munched on everything I could lay my hands on at the snack bar so I didn't have to concentrate on the movie.  He said, ""...nope, Poppy, I remember my first bicycle, my first custom skate board and my first bedroom furniture as well as the many movies you sat through!""

I was surprised he didn't question me about my heart attack (which he knows about) - probably afraid to talk about it with me.

Agreed, that happens and is a good thing.

I mean there are lots of cases when the defense lawyer knows his client is guilty, and the lawyer defends him, and often gets him off. I doubt it is because the lawyer truly believes the defendant is guilty...he does it for the money and because he is skilled at getting the guilty off. The lawyer will say it is his job to protect everyone, but, I think that is just an excuse so he can sleep at nights. In my opinion the OJ Simpson case exemplifies this, and Johnnie Cochran was his lawyer. At least they finally got OJ for robbery.

I know not every one would agree with me. I have a tennis buddy who is a lawyer and he only takes cases of a decent nature........doesn't want to defend criminals.

Well said and I agree completely. But, and i am only speaking for myself, if I had to defend someone who I was pretty sure did it....I don't think I could do it. OTOH, it is a great and wonderful thing that we can all be represented in a court of law. Much better than being thrown off a building or being locked in a cell for a few years.

I really like reading and seeing movies that are legal thrillers. I have often thought what an awful life it would be, defending a murderer or drug dealer etc. I am glad people do it, but, I am glad I don't have to do it.

Believe me, where I live I'll easily find a place to use 400+ horsepower. On almost every drive. I can say that I had no problem giving my friend's 500+ hp AMG a proper workout(and that's not counting the 100foot burnout I performed-at said friend's request-pulling out of my driveway.

When we go we usually give our card issuer our itinerary so they know where we should be making charges on our trip.
Snake....the cruise line (Royal Caribbean) did offer drink packages. The one I was interested in (with my bourbons listed as included) ran $57/day. That's $400 for the week, plus tip. Seemed excessive.

When talking to AMEX about my card, they said it didn't matter where I was when I incur charges as cc numbers are captured and sold in seconds, and charges could end up being made anywhere in the world at that point. It just so happened I was in NJ and that's where they found the number being used. As I look back, I bought lunch using my AMEX at EWR. Plenty of people could have seen my number...the people sitting to either side of me when I paid for my lunch, the waitress, the cashier, or someone sitting around capturing cc numbers on their laptop when mine was swiped in the cc machine.

I tried to give AMEX my itinerary before I left. But, they said it was unneeded because of their algorithms used for fraud and the amount of traveling I do for work.

Snake, the Mustang is sold by packages. Base is the same on 6 cyl or 8 cyl. Premium can be had on either as well. Premium has SYNC, Shaker stereo and bluetooth. Non premium has basic stereo, cloth seats, less chrome. They both look and function similarly. I started with a 6 cyl and traded it for a GT (Both premium interiors) within 4 months. Lost very little on the trade. Wife heard the 6 start up in the garage and said ""it doesn't sound like a Mustang"". Next day I had the GT and never looked back.
Thanks, I wasn't sure if there were any viable differences between the two except for the engine. But for me the extra power alone doesn't justify the additional expense. A few thousand difference I might consider but not the one we are talking about.

I am not to sure about that, I picture the people taking dictation being the ones driving sports cars with turbo 4 bangers.

The ecoboost provides about 3% more HP and slight better gas mileage ( which vanishes due to PUG being recommended) for several thousand more. I wouldn't say it would be cost effective.

No, but I've always wanted a V8 powered car.  If I buy the small popcorn & want more I can always get it or get a bigger one the next time I go to the movies.

We're only rationalizing buying a V6 over a V8 or vise versa.  ""If I find I would rather have the V8, I can get it next time!""

My suggestion is to carefully analyze the options, drive both cars (V6 and V8), determine which fits your desires, then buy that one.  It's an expensive decision if you end up buying a car that is less satisfying.

I had a CLS550 in 2014.  I found the 402 hp to be a bit overpowered for my tastes and needs - they did not have a V6 twin turbo at the time in their lineup.  When I drove the 2016 CLS400, I found the 330 hp and 354 ft lbs of torque to be fast and powerful enough for my needs - it has the punch I like when I need it and moves off the line faster than most cars.

I certainly would never have bought the CLS550 again.  Additionally, 31 mpg highway and 20 mpg city is much more economical.  Too bad they didn't have the CLS400 back in 2014.



If you want raw power from Ford wait for the new GT, it's supposed to produce more than 600 HP.

FYI, I have had really good experience so far with the Amazon-branded iphone cables. Cheaper and sturdier and no compatibility conflicts. I think the one in my car is about 2 years old now and still looks new. I also have one on my nightstand for nighttime charging. The kids use that one alot, too, and that's also still perfect. My wife, on the other hand, has managed to break the ends off the 2 she has, although they still function. Not sure what she does to them. But, this is the same woman who could destroy an Apple-brand cable in about 3 months.
It is definitely not a ""you get what you pay for"" situation for a lot of things. many people pay top dollar for pretty much crap with a name. Look at things like Beats headphones, you can get better for less than half the price.

Sound like the insurance company actually expects overruns on the repair costs if the insurance company is paying. They'd rather just give you a little more and not be responsible for those extra cost items that get discovered at the shop.
It is more likely that the insurance company is using a standard, or average, rate for the area and that the shop being utilized is low for the area. I can't see an insurance company adding funds just in case.

So, think I mentioned that while the wife is away in China for an extended stay, I was going to take a cruise, which I did, last week.

Always fun, but a little different doing it solo. Interesting, though...how people react to you when they find out you're solo. Different story for a different time, however.

Anyway, got back last Saturday. I had cruised out of Bayonne, NJ. New ship (Anthem of the Seas), so it was beautiful. Itinerary wasn't so great (NJ to Cape Canaveral to Bahamas and back).

Those of you who have never cruised, while most food and entertainment is included, drinks and casino plar are/is not. Drinks are probably a bit overpriced, but aside from a couple of beers and some good bourbon at day's end, I wasn't the lush some onboard appeared to be.

I check my credit cards and bank accounts twice a day to check on every charge or withdrawal to pay bills.  You just can't be too careful these days.
You cannot try to open an AMEX black card for anyone else but yourself and only then when you are invited to by AMEX. To get the so called black card you have to have an AMEX platinum card, have a high income and net worth, spend a ton of money using the platinum card and be invited to apply.

I know some of you consider this a dead horse, but this article linked above is about a new study that just recently came out showing driverless cars are getting into twice as many accidents as normal average drivers (albeit all not at fault accidents). The reason? Driving the speed limit. Going slower than the average pace of traffic does indeed lead to greater danger and accidents; double in this case. Yes, the Solomon curve still applies, and is proven yet again.

@snakeweasel might want to change is worldview in light of this new evidence that further establishes I was right on just about everything we argued about yet again.
A couple of things, first is that the number of driverless cars out there are extremely small, something like 0.001% of the cars on the road. Google earlier this year stated that their driverless cars traveled 700,000 miles in total which sounds like a lot until you figure in that Americans travel some 2,500,000,000,000 miles annually. This means that the sample is way to small to make such a determination.

As for the solomon curve, you forget that the solomon curve does not take into consideration of stopped and turning cars, when they are eliminated your going faster is safer falls on its face. Other studies show this but since it doesn't support your position you ignore them.

That's the problem, snake. I have a platinum card and charge everything on it, and I mean everything! My cell phone bill, my house telephone bill, my daily newspaper delivery, my utilities, food, clothes, etc. I have other cards, but I run zero balances on them. I once considered closing 4 credit cards, but I was told that it would negatively affect my FICO scores.

I did receive an invite for a black card (unlimited credit, from what it said) right about the time my identity was stolen 8 years ago, but it made no sense to me. I have even charged down payments on new cars with my AMEX - I charged $18,000 on the 2014 CLS 550, but I did get an immediate call from AMEX to make sure it was me charging that amount on the card. When I confirmed it was me, the charge went through.

Almost put $19,000 on the AMEX when I bought the 2016 CLS 400 last month, but the 1.75% simple interest loan for 60 months was so attractive, I decided to take out a loan. That same loan today would be over 2%, which still isn't bad considering it's a 60 month loan.

IIRC Buick has been losing some market share. I still believe GM has some issues and constraints with Buick. While it was probably necessary to keep the line in the US market while it was developing and gaining strength in Asia given cultural traits over there, that is probably not as critical today. However, GM has a fair number of Buick/GMC dealerships and I'm not sure GMC sales volume can keep them going without another line. They could add GMC to Cadillac I suppose, but they've culled the number of Caddy dealerships to make the line more exclusive, so I'm not sure how that would work out.

Buick's market share tracks the overall market and generally has been doing well after hitting bottom in '09:



Buick sold 229,000 units last year and claimed sales growth of 11%. They really don't sell all that many units of the Lacrosse - it is long in the tooth and getting expensive. It's a large sedan and you don't sell many of them these days anyway. I'm waiting to see the new one in the flesh but I figure it will be an improvement Buick needs to update all their models as they are all getting rather tired.

Try a total reset of the phone - that will take the phone back to its original factory settings.

For the first time in a LOOOONNNNNGGGG time, I was actually a casino winner playing blackjack, and where I really won quite a bit, 3 card poker. All-in-all, I was probably up at one time by $1,600, but ended up about $1,400 when all was said and done...enough to pay for the cruise, just about.

They keep a credit card on file (in my case, AMEX) for your drinks, and the very stupid art auctions (which seem shady to me), incidentals, etc. My total bill at the end of the week was about $125 for drinks. Didn't buy any art, nor jewelry, or anything else for that matter.

Arrived back home and got a call a day later from AMEX questioning a charge I had made. I bought some Christmas gifts in the Bahamas and figured they were questioning those.

Nope....it was for $2,400 somewhere in NJ, appeared to be electronics. I was shocked. I told the nice AMEX agent it wasn't me. I also inquired when these charges happened. She said ""it's happening now"". I guess they got lucky to have caught me immediately. And, from what I could tell, they nabbed the thief on the spot. So, expecting this in the Bahamas, it actually happened in NJ. Who knows how they got my number. I ate at a restaurant in the airport and put it on my AMEX. But, that would have meant someone in the restaurant was stealing numbers. Could have been one of those people who scan people's pockets, and an airport would be a perfect place to do so. Someone who works for the cruise company?

I sure don't like that feeling, either way, given I travel for work so much.

They had a new card to me by Monday. I guess AMEX got lucky in catching the perps. I was even luckier given they were diligent and I am not responsible.

When I canceled my social security I had to give back $15k. Charged it on my credit card. I was expecting a call from Chase as it was the largest single charge I ever made.

Nothing.

Guess they don't care if someone is running a tab on my dime.

Negatives of Moving to Kansas City

Weather – Located on the plains, Kansas City can get hit hard by wind and cold weather, though temperatures stay more moderate than further-north cities, like Chicago and Minneapolis. Summers can see extremely hot and humid temperatures.

Tornadoes – Kansas City is located in the middle of Tornado Alley, making its tornado-prone status worthy of its own “bad weather” section. The metro was hit hard by tornadoes in 1957 and 2003.

Heat and humidity are relative. I've been to Florida many times and I know the difference between here are there.

I enjoy a little cold weather and snow, but I have never been near, nor have I ever seen a tornado in my 73 years in the mid west. Plus I have never known anyone that was affected by one.

The actual ""plains"" are west of KC. It is very hilly with lots of trees where I live. Lots of Lakes.

660,December 2015,henryn,"Okay, some free advice from a professional. Which, of course, is worth exactly what you’re paying for it.

It is always better to perform a clean install of an operating system. Upgrades in place are never the best idea. Sometimes an upgrade in place will go very smoothly, and work just fine. But the best odds of getting a happy ending are found when you do a clean install.

This means backing up everything that you want to keep. All of your docs, spreadsheets, pictures, any financial records (Quicken, whatever), your browser favorites, everything.

Then wiping the hard drive, everything gone. Install the new version of the operating system from scratch, complete with drivers. Then reload your applications (Office, Quicken, Irfan, whatever, whatever). Then restore your data.

Long, involved, labor intensive? You bet. My advice for most people, and I do get asked, quite often. If you have a good working installation of Windows 7 or 8 or 8.1, no problems, everything smooth – leave it the he__ alone.

If you really really want that shiny new toy (operating system), then buy a new computer and move everything over.

Ah yes, the dreaded bug issue. That can be a problem, although personally, we haven't had much of a problem, except for wiping the ones off the front of the car after going on the highway.

People have had ants problems. 2 guys told me they parked on the grass at an airport parking lot and when they came back their cars were full of ants. Seems in the rainy weather they climb out of the ground and seek higher drier places.

I guess all places have advantages and disadvantages....just depends on which ones are most important to each person.

Whatever the issues, most people I see here love being here in the winter.....whatever the downsides are. Ideally, it would be nice to have a place in the North for the summer. But, some people are here all year and they find a way to manage...just stay in the a/c or go to the pool.

There is no doubt that because South Florida is in a sub-tropical zone, we are, at times, bothered by certain critters like centipedes (find them crawling under my front door at times during rainy season every so often), ants (black, red, big, tiny - usually during dry season when they go looking for water), iguanas, salamanders (a very prolific reptilian that ranges in size between 2"" and 4"", that love sneaking into the apartment when I open the front door - find their remains a few weeks later - but at least they eat the ants), squirrels, raccoons, turtles, alligators (usually found near ponds and lakes which we have plenty of), and scores of species of birds and ducks and geese - depending upon the season). Yes, it is always a joy to come face-to-face with nature here in God's Waiting Room. The critters remind you from time-to-time that they were here first and have a claim to the land.

Ghost towns can be comforting, driver! During the summer months, my building is half empty. Now, most of the parking spaces that are reserved for owners have cars in them. Traffic is awful. This morning, I went to the mall to walk a little - need to get some exercise no matter how slow I walk - and you should have seen the place. Just as empty as it was the other two times I was up there at 9:00 AM. The stores are open, but no customers. The best time to do Christmas shopping is when the stores first open - it's a pleasure. But the security guards I know up there tell me that at 1:00 PM, it's like half time at a New England Patriot Game in Boston - hoards and hoards of people everywhere.

675,December 2015,bwia,"The 2017 Buick Lacrosse 

I've been looking at some photos of the new 2017 Buick Lacrosse and I don't share the upbeat sentiments of some of the reviewers.

First off, the exterior design is more Lucerne than LaCrosse, especially the rear end, which looks like the Buick Century.  Second it has lost the ""sporty"" pretensions of the current model; and third, it appears to be lower, wider and corpulent - a design statement that totally abandons its current demographic. 

If Buick wants to reintroduce the Lucerne that's fine but don't call the 2017 a LaCrosse. On the other hand GM is famous for bad timing, bloated and overpriced automobiles."
676,December 2015,berri,"IIRC Buick has been losing some market share. I still believe GM has some issues and constraints with Buick. While it was probably necessary to keep the line in the US market while it was developing and gaining strength in Asia given cultural traits over there, that is probably not as critical today. However, GM has a fair number of Buick/GMC dealerships and I'm not sure GMC sales volume can keep them going without another line. They could add GMC to Cadillac I suppose, but they've culled the number of Caddy dealerships to make the line more exclusive, so I'm not sure how that would work out. Bringing some Buick models from China and basing domestically built ones on Chinese models may be an economical way to keep Buick operating here profitably at lower sales volumes.

Mike, Florida just reached a population of over 20 million making it number 3 in the country, after California and Texas. Most of the new comers are from New York state.

Traffic seems to be a problem everywhere in Florida. Roads are getting crowded as fast as they are made. 301 was a two lane back country road 4 years ago when we came here. Now, because of all the new surveys and stores it is 6 lanes - and that is very busy, seems like a race track at rush hour.

Expect more as the baby boomers and new e-commerce businesses move to the sunshine state. Even more people are moving to Miami, that is attracting people (a lot of high rollers) from all over the world, who want to park there money in a pretty stable country.

692,December 2015,graphicguy,"So, think I mentioned that while the wife is away in China for an extended stay, I was going to take a cruise, which I did, last week.

Always fun, but a little different doing it solo. Interesting, though...how people react to you when they find out you're solo. Different story for a different time, however.

Anyway, got back last Saturday. I had cruised out of Bayonne, NJ. New ship (Anthem of the Seas), so it was beautiful. Itinerary wasn't so great (NJ to Cape Canaveral to Bahamas and back).

Those of you who have never cruised, while most food and entertainment is included, drinks and casino plar are/is not. Drinks are probably a bit overpriced, but aside from a couple of beers and some good bourbon at day's end, I wasn't the lush some onboard appeared to be.

For the first time in a LOOOONNNNNGGGG time, I was actually a casino winner playing blackjack, and where I really won quite a bit, 3 card poker. All-in-all, I was probably up at one time by $1,600, but ended up about $1,400 when all was said and done...enough to pay for the cruise, just about.

They keep a credit card on file (in my case, AMEX) for your drinks, and the very stupid art auctions (which seem shady to me), incidentals, etc. My total bill at the end of the week was about $125 for drinks. Didn't buy any art, nor jewelry, or anything else for that matter.

Arrived back home and got a call a day later from AMEX questioning a charge I had made. I bought some Christmas gifts in the Bahamas and figured they were questioning those.

Nope....it was for $2,400 somewhere in NJ, appeared to be electronics. I was shocked. I told the nice AMEX agent it wasn't me. I also inquired when these charges happened. She said ""it's happening now"". I guess they got lucky to have caught me immediately. And, from what I could tell, they nabbed the thief on the spot. So, expecting this in the Bahamas, it actually happened in NJ. Who knows how they got my number. I ate at a restaurant in the airport and put it on my AMEX. But, that would have meant someone in the restaurant was stealing numbers. Could have been one of those people who scan people's pockets, and an airport would be a perfect place to do so. Someone who works for the cruise company?

I sure don't like that feeling, either way, given I travel for work so much.

They had a new card to me by Monday. I guess AMEX got lucky in catching the perps. I was even luckier given they were diligent and I am not responsible.

I had a problem with my printers after going to Windows 10. I went to the web sites and downloaded drivers compatible with Windows 10 and they started working again. Other than that pretty smooth sailing so far. This desktop is a Dell XPS 8300 and it has plenty of horsepower.

707,December 2015,carnaught,"Actually CC fraud is the easiest to reverse, and the most cc companies do not hold you responsible for over $50 in fraudulent charges. AMEX is especially good at protecting you. I am more concerned about i.d. theft to a bank account, or especially getting one's personal info. like your SS number. They can set up a line a credit, and buy under your name.

My sister had an envelope, with her payment by check to her utility company, opened, the check was washed and forged to the perpetrator. She just happened to go to her bank acct. site, and see a copy of this check within a day. Calling the bank about it, they credited the few hundred bucks back to her. The perp., however, got away with it (happened in S. Fl.), but at least she recovered her funds."
708,December 2015,henryn,"“most cc companies do not hold you responsible for over $50 in fraudulent charges.”

Federal law limits your maximum loss from credit card fraud / theft to $50.

Search for FCBA (Fair Credit Billing Act).

The liability for a debit card is a little more complex. If you report the loss within 2 days, the limit is $50. More than 2 days, less than 60 days, $500. The problem with the debit card is that it can take days / weeks / months for the bank or other financial institution to replace the missing funds.

I prefer to use a debit card, but I use my Amex much more often because I have better protection and less to lose.

The reason I prefer to use the debit card might seem silly to some, but it’s real to me. If I pay cash (debit), the expenditure is done and over with. If I use the Amex card, then when the bill comes in and I have to write the check, it’s like I’m spending the money a second time.

If I spend several hundred dollars on some new toy, I don’t want the pain of paying for it to happen twice.

Here in Florida, we are very lucky - no inheritance taxes and no income taxes. I also have a $25,000 homestead exemption for the property taxes on my condo (permanent residents get that exemption after a certain length of time and then you have to apply for it). My property taxes are just under $700 a year - more than reasonable.

The only things I have to worry about regarding inheritance is personal and real property (Condo, furniture/contents and Car), and that is covered in my will. Everything else is POD which is how I have all my accounts listed. So the State and Federal Governments don't get a thing (my estate is much too small to be affected by Federal Estate Taxes).

Now that I have some real health problems, I want to make sure everything is in order, if you know what I mean.

I told the body shop to go ahead and fix it. They do terrific work. Have it back the first week in January and throw the cover on it until March or April or, if the weather continues like it has, drop the top and drive about.

Sound like the insurance company actually expects overruns on the repair costs if the insurance company is paying. They'd rather just give you a little more and not be responsible for those extra cost items that get discovered at the shop.

Weather – Located on the plains, Kansas City can get hit hard by wind and cold weather, though temperatures stay more moderate than further-north cities, like Chicago and Minneapolis. Summers can see extremely hot and humid temperatures.

Tornadoes – Kansas City is located in the middle of Tornado Alley, making its tornado-prone status worthy of its own “bad weather” section. The metro was hit hard by tornadoes in 1957 and 2003.

Good thing they don't sue in Dominican Republic as quickly as they do in the USA. I bet if you hit that guy in the US he would be on the phone calling 1-800- GARY or one of the other lawyers who are advertised on TV all day long. If you are in an accident call....so and so right now. One guy claims to take your call 24 hours a day, probably takes the call while on the throne.

Then there is a lawyer who will help you no matter what kind of record you have or how many crimes you have committed. I think his motto is you're not guilty until they find you guilty.

A short time ago a Canadian was in a minor accident in Cuba. He was in prison for 3 months and legal costs were $30000.

Briefly:

Canadian tourists should think twice before getting behind the wheel during trips in Mexico, China, Guatemala and Cuba, the Foreign Affairs Department warns.

“Canadians involved in traffic accidents may face serious legal problems, including imprisonment,” the department website says.

The caution comes as 19-year-old Cody LeCompte prepares to leave Cuba after being detained since April 29. He is expected to return Tuesday to a welcoming party planned by family and friends.

LeCompte, of Norfolk County, was detained by Cuban authorities after the rental car he was driving collided with a truck on a pockmarked road near rural Camaguey, sending himself, his mother, uncle and a female Cuban friend to hospital.

LeCompte was never charged in the crash, but was forced to stay at the Gran Club Santa Lucia in Cuba until the investigation was completed. The family must now deal with a crushing debt of $30,000 that it spent on lawyers, flights and hotel rooms.

“It doesn’t feel real,” LeCompte said from his hotel room in Cuba. “I can’t believe I’ve been here for three months for a car accident.”

Similar sad fates could await tourists bold enough to rent vehicles in Mexico, China and Guatemala. Foreign affairs warns Canadians involved in traffic accidents shouldn’t expect to be treated like they are innocent until proven guilty.

Sometimes we forget many countries have very different laws.

Demand for crude oil has dropped significantly and the Saudi's, Iranians and Emirate States are continuing to flood the oil market.  I read in the paper that OPEC is out to force decreased production in the U.S. and once that is accomplished, will cut their own production.  But countries like Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Mexico and Iraq depend so heavily on oil exports for their economies that they can't afford to cut production - in fact they are increasing production as well to maintain their fragile economies.

I really don't want to spend the money - I'd rather leave my money for my kids who both need it.  The condo is worth about $125,000 and is free and clear.

I just like my bedroom - just large enough for me and in the front of the condo.

I have a large closet in my bedroom - I only use 1/2 of it.  I use the master bedroom walk-in closet for storing things like the vacuum, tools, folding chairs and table, art work, extra carpeting, snack tables, etc.  there is also another large closet like the one in my room which is empty and a large linen closet.  I also have a terrace that is the width of the living room.  I keep the fold-up shutters closed so I don't have to worry about rain and wind.  I open the sliding doors for cross ventilation - the shutters have tiny holes in them to allow air to flow in and out and I have jallosy windows in the front door that I open in cooler weather.  The condo ventilation comes from the northeast and southwest - excellent ventilation in cooler weather.

FYI, I have had really good experience so far with the Amazon-branded iphone cables. Cheaper and sturdier and no compatibility conflicts.

I owned a 2004 Grand Marquis, and it never got that kind of mileage. More like 20 or 21 on the highway, and 14 in town. And I always keep written records, record every fill up, do the math myself (never trust a lie-o-meter).

My new 2015 F150 is actually doing 20 mpg overall, for the first 1200 miles. Which sames amazing to me.
Maybe different gearing. Mine has an ""economy"" 3.09 rear which takes some of the off the line guts away. Make for better cruising milage.

Maybe my lie-o-meter isn't being honest.

Well, I did have one issue with a seat belt in the Miata which is still up in the air as to whether they total it or not. If they don't no problem. $500. If they do I want to see if I can collect the money, add a little of my own and get it done. Great body shop. Worst case scenario is I pocket the insurance check. The reason things are going so long is they need to tear the front down, particularly the front bumper cover. Looking for hidden damage, If they only find a little no problem; a lot problem. A little tap up front. You don't buy Miatas for their durability.

I don't get upset when people have problems with GM. People have problems with every car company.

I do get troubled by the constant bashing that GM takes here and elsewhere from a certain bunch of people. They seem to be held to a different standard. Why that is I can only speculate. I have been a GM customer for a long time, over 35 years. I have had other makes in that time also. The most troublesome and undependable car I have owned in that time was a new Toyota - go figure. I have known some GM cars to be troublesome, but that is true of any make. It happens. What I get riled about are posts like those from a certain member here whose username begins with ""a"" that are simply generalized bashing, constantly, based upon what exactly, I am not sure, which he seems to have taken to heart. That is something to really be curious about.
I'm glad GM has some 35 year fans such as you. It's actually a good thing as if there weren't at least some of you, then the GM subsidies and bailouts asked of each taxpayer for the GM fanboys warranties to stay in tact and alive would be even greater.

This isn't a generalized bash, I'm specifically upset I have to pay for warranty work (indirectly) through my tax payments for people that buy GM and Chrysler vehicles. I'm equally upset I have to pay for golden parachutes for a lot of wall street banks too. I just wish the GM fanboys would cut checks big enough to GM for their vehicles so that us taxpayers don't have to shoulder the burden.

My wife got her two $500 goodwill gift-cards from VW already; that was fast (as we didn't rush to sign up)! Still waiting on that ""goodwill"" check from Chrysler for the embarrassment their products caused in the 90's and early 2000's.

Definitely agree.

The dealer in the fancy shmancy area knows people don't want to drive a few more miles to save a few $1000s. Also, a lot of these cars are driven by their wives, and heaven forbid their wife may have to drive for an extra 20 minutes for service. The fancy area dealer knows this. They know they will make more profit with this business plan.

Our former Audi dealer tried to get full MSRP for the A4 once. When I told him bmw was giving me 4% off they matched it immediately. He explained, we are in an area with mostly business people, they are pretty sophisticated buyers, so we don't fool around with them. bmw could get full msrp, Audi knew they couldn't.

People do know that you don't have to service your vehicle at the dealer you bought it from? You can get warranty service at any dealership location for that brand.

Good thing they don't sue in Dominican Republic as quickly as they do in the USA. I bet if you hit that guy in the US he would be on the phone calling 1-800- GARY or one of the other lawyers who are advertised on TV all day long. If you are in an accident call....so and so right now. One guy claims to take your call 24 hours a day, probably takes the call while on the throne.

Then there is a lawyer who will help you no matter what kind of record you have or how many crimes you have committed. I think his motto is you're not guilty until they find you guilty.

When gas is $5 a gallon, and take home pay is much less than we are used to, people tend not to buy Mustang GTs and Hellcats....or even Grande Marquis.

The plaintive wanted $3000 because that is what the garage said it would cost to fix. He had a picture of the car and it wasn't in great shape, and it was missing a rear wheel disc. Plaintive said that was off before but he drove it liked that because everyone thought it was cool not to have a disc on the rear wheel.

Defendant said he was backing up and the plaintive was in the passenger seat talking and waving his arms and that distracted him.

Dear Car Talk:

OK, I'm an old geezer. A relic. An antique. And whatever else describes ""mature individuals."" I still love my Mercury Grand Marquis. But, just like me, they don't make them anymore. I love being able to take everything I own when I go on vacation, including the kitchen sink.

I realize they failed to change the body style for several decades, so the entire line went dormant. But what is available now that will replace my Mercury when I get ready to give up the one I have now? Great column! I get you guys every week in the paper, and look forward to your comments and advice.

ANSWER

Dormant? It went ""dinosaurial.""

Unfortunately, the Gran Marquis became badly outdated in many ways, and Ford Motor Company didn't see enough future sales to justify the investment in a redesign. Many of your fellow geezers, not to mention all of New York City's taxi drivers, join you in your grief, Charles.

There's nothing exactly like it out there now. But I'll make a few suggestions, and you can shop around and see what you like.

First, since the Grand Marquis bit the dust, I've noticed that a lot of taxi drivers have switched to Toyota Camry Hybrids. It's got the opposite of a large V-8: It has a four-cylinder engine, a battery pack and a supplemental electric motor. But it's got good power (200 hp), it's a full-size car, it's comfortable and safe, and it's got room for a kitchen sink or two. And by the way, it gets about 40 miles to the gallon, in town and on the highway.

If that's not quite big enough, you could step up to the Toyota Avalon, which is a little plusher and a little bigger. It's also available with a 40-mpg hybrid drivetrain

Another option would be a Chrysler 300. That's a rear-wheel-drive, American (actually, part German) sedan that you can still get with a big V-8 (you can get it with all-wheel drive, too, if you want to). It's got that lightweight steering feel that you love in your Grand Marquis, and it's fairly roomy.

The biggest downside is that the visibility is pretty bad. It has tall sides and narrow windows, and, after driving your Grand Marquis, you might feel like you're trying to see out of a bathtub in the 300. But try it and see.

Finally, you might try one of Ford Motor Company's full-size replacements for the Gran Marquis. Perhaps something like the Lincoln MKS, which is based on the Ford Fusion but will positively pamper your geezer butt, Charles.

Let us know what you decide, and how you like it.

NOTE: I would have said about the same, though some of those choices may cost more than $40k. Maybe a Taurus, Impala or Lucerne.

I got a 2008 Wrangler Rubicon with a few options. It came out to $38k (I'm not sure if that was before or after tax.)

We traded it in 3 years and 2 months later with 24k miles and a pretty big ding in the bumper (wish I could say it was off roading. Truth is I hit a lamp post making a U-turn.) We got $29k for it.

I owned a 2004 Grand Marquis, and it never got that kind of mileage. More like 20 or 21 on the highway, and 14 in town. And I always keep written records, record every fill up, do the math myself (never trust a lie-o-meter).

But I still reminisce about my Oldsmobiles.
Like father/like son, ditto. From the mid 60s until 3 years ago my parents typically had an Olds or Cadillac in the driveway, with their last being a 98 Aurora. They now have a CR-V. I owned many Olds in the past and was upset when GM announced that Olds was being shuttered in 2001. Of all the GM car divisions at that time I thought Olds had the most attractive and up to date product offering.

Like father/like son - not here, at least with cars. My dad was a Ford man to the extent that there were only two kinds of cars, Fords and other Fords. Me I'll buy most brands as long as the car interests me and fills my desires. I have owned cars from the Detroit gang and several imports. I don't care about the make (as long as it's not a Toyota) as long as I like it, and it does what I want it to do.

BTW the only Ford I would get right now would be the Mustang, but I might be enticed to get the electric Focus as I have test driven one once and was really pleased.

Sorry to hear that.  Unfortunately, I believe that great looking wheels add a special dimension to the attractiveness of a car.  What's the first thing that attracts your attention on a great looking car?  The wheels of course.

If you plan on keeping the car for several years, consider adding sharp alloy wheels.  I have the 19"" ""multispoked"" AMG wheels. They were a $1000 option over the 18"" standard wheel.  They are painted a dark gray, but you don't notice they are painted until you get close.  But they are machined alloys,

I would think you could get a nice set of wheels on the secondary market real cheap.
I'll have to disagree with you on that one. The wheels are one of the last things I notice on a car, what attracts my attention on a great looking car is the lines of the body. But I will add that good wheels make a car look better. My Sebring came with aluminum wheels that the detail guy (gal?) at the dealership neglected to clean when the car was delivered. When I gave them a good cleaning man did they stand out and in a good way. Unfortunately 6 years and close to 90K miles took their toll.

Funny you should mention Mt. Shasta. My son and his ex-wife were married in Redding, CA, I remember seeing Mt. Shasta in the distance - covered in snow of course.

Beautiful country up there - almost untouched north of Redding with all the forests. Winters are too cold for me up there, but the summers are beautiful.

Well according to Fords website the base V-6 starts at $25,600 where the GT starts at $34,100 so it's close to 10K. However I was looking at the ragtop when I compared prices which are $31,100 and $43,600 respectively.

Of course that is just the starting MSPR for each engine size and comparing them with the same equipment might give different numbers but the base V-6 is a lot less expensive than the base V-8.

I actually saw an ad for a Ford dealer this morning. They had a new Mustang for $21k, and a GT model for $38k. I thought to myself, that is one huge spread for the same model car. I would really hesitate to lay out $38k for a car that is pretty much the same as the $21k car. I know it is different, but not double different!

When you go to the movies do you buy the extra large drink and extra large popcorn knowing full well that you will only consume half of it and throw away the rest?
Price of a small popcorn is about $5, a medium is $5.50, and an enormous is $5.75. So, yeh, sometimes it would seem worth it to buy the largest one and eat what you can and dump the rest out.....in case you are hungrier than you expected to be.

The one thing I wonder is what is optional on the V-6 that's standard on the GT? It does make a difference if the additional standard equipment is something you would buy if you got the V-6, but it's meaningless if it's not.

I am thinking that a Mustang could be my next car but not the GT. The V-6 is plenty powerful enough and I cannot justifying spending $10K+ more for power that I would only use 0.1% of the time.

We're only rationalizing buying a V6 over a V8 or vise versa.  ""If I find I would rather have the V8, I can get it next time!""

My suggestion is to carefully analyze the options, drive both cars (V6 and V8), determine which fits your desires, then buy that one.  It's an expensive decision if you end up buying a car that is less satisfying.

I had a CLS550 in 2014.  I found the 402 hp to be a bit overpowered for my tastes and needs - they did not have a V6 twin turbo at the time in their lineup.  When I drove the 2016 CLS400, I found the 330 hp and 354 ft lbs of torque to be fast and powerful enough for my needs - it has the punch I like when I need it and moves off the line faster than most cars.

I certainly would never have bought the CLS550 again.  Additionally, 31 mpg highway and 20 mpg city is much more economical.  Too bad they didn't have the CLS400 back in 2014.

I got up early this morning because I had quite a bit of Christmas shopping to do since I was unable to complete gift-selection prior to my heart problem. I drove up to the Boca Town Center in Boca Raton and hit Macy's, Apple, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom's and my last stop was Bloomingdale's for me!

I had that $500 gift card to Bloomingdale's so I decided to buy 4 Polo Ralph Lauren 2-button short sleeve golf shirts, 1/2 dozen Calvin Klein anklet sport socks and a 5 fluid ounce bottle of Chanel ALLURE Sport Cologne. The tab, with tax came to $497.22. The nice thing about that is I will receive a Bloomingdale's $100 gift card in the mail as a rewards bonus for purchasing Polo Ralph Lauren merchandise today. So my $500 gift card ended up as a $600 gift card. But let's face it, $89.95 for each golf shirt is more than I have ever paid for a short sleeve golf shirt - but when you subtract the $25.00 per shirt rebate, it isn't so bad. Besides, I""ve never had Ralph Lauren Polo Golf Shirts nor Chanel ALLURE Sport ($120.00). I'd never spend that much for cologne either - but I figured, what the heck - I'll smell like a millionaire which is the closest I'll ever come to actually being one.

I had so many packages and shopping bags that I left the shopping bags with what I purchased at each store. They have a special service whereby they sent someone to all the stores to pick up my Christmas gifts and they met me at my car and loaded everything in the trunk for me. What a great service - especially for someone like me at this point in my recovery.

On the way home I stopped off for gas and then to the dealership for a car wash. I actually drove with the the moon roof wide open - no need for air-conditioning today - it's 72 degrees out - beautiful. I then came home and opened up all the windows and the sliding glass door to the terrace to bring some fresh air into the house for a change. I then had some lunch, hung up my new shirts and turned on my computer for the first time in a month or so. I am exhausted, but it is obvious I am getting much stronger and have a bit more stamina. I know walking is important for exercise. What I might do is try getting back to my walking slowly to build up my strength.

This is the most active day I have had in almost a month - it sure felt good to be able to handle the shopping at the mall.

Funny you should mention Mt. Shasta. My son and his ex-wife were married in Redding, CA, I remember seeing Mt. Shasta in the distance - covered in snow of course.

Split rims were used on 3/4 ton and larger trucks until the late sixties I believe. You had to wrestle the tire onto the rim and then place the ring between the tire bead and the rim. You then took a special hammer and you beat the ring into the groove. You had to make very sure you had it seated properly.

Then you (hopefully) placed the whole thing in a hoop cage where you slowly added air hoping the ring didn't pop off. A lot of injuries and even deaths resulted from exploding split rims.

I love Wranglers.....in Moab. Anywhere else and I'm not such a fan. That's why we rent them locally, and every time I jump on the highway between trails I'm grateful I never dropped any serious coin on one. I grew up with Wranglers in the family and learned to off road on the Rubicon trail in them. While I thought they were cool and exciting back in high school, as an adult I just wouldn't want one as a daily driver.

I had a set of Michelin Harmony tires on my leSabre, which I believe were mileage warrantied
for 80,000 miles. At somewhere over 80,000 miles, they still had 3-4/32 of depth: still looked good
but wouldn't have nearly as much grip on snow for winter, so I changed them for a set of
Michelin Destiny tires since the Harmony version had been discontinued.

Tires were rotated every 6-9,000 miles and kept at about 33-35 pounds of
pressure instead of 30 recommended by Buick. Much of the mileage was
interstate driving traveling. Manager at the tire store beamed at the mileage
I had gotten and that they were still driveable tires.

It's like color printer ink. If you are printing pictures and you used black ink only, it would be different shades of black. If you use color ink it will be a bit more expensive, but you are using a color in that area instead of shades of black.......it is more expensive using color ink....but not that much more.

The mention of inventing things reminded me or an article in Classic Cars that listed the 5 breakthroughs that really changed the auto industry.

1. Detachable tires. Michelin came up with a clincher rim so the tire wasn't glued to the wheel and could be changed without cutting it off--1891.
2. High strength steel.
3. Rise of mass production. Thank Henry Ford.
4. The Art and Colour staff of General Motors which implemented a way of changing cars yearly to sell more, and for their hierarchy of makes and models price positioned in a way to give them social status meaning.
5. Safety and emissions regulations.

No idea is a bad idea. You have identified a problem, rear window gets covered with road spray. I don't know if a sliding window is the answer, but a rear wiper or a spray nozzle might work. Also, those reverse slanting windows on the 1965 Mercuries might help.....everything old is new again.

Sorry to hear that.  Unfortunately, I believe that great looking wheels add a special dimension to the attractiveness of a car.  What's the first thing that attracts your attention on a great looking car?  The wheels of course.

If you plan on keeping the car for several years, consider adding sharp alloy wheels.  I have the 19"" ""multispoked"" AMG wheels. They were a $1000 option over the 18"" standard wheel.  They are painted a dark gray, but you don't notice they are painted until you get close.  But they are machined alloys,

I would think you could get a nice set of wheels on the secondary market real cheap.

You may also look at Rockauto.com.

They have reconditioned wheels (by Keystone in my case). But be sure you are positive the description
exactly matches the finish of your wheel. If not known, look up the trunk tag (RPO) that shows the options
that were installed on your car for the code for your wheels. There are websites that list the RPO code
and their meanings or look on the window sticker for option codes.

If a wheel you want is not currently in stock at Rockauto.com, you can keep checking back or
in some cases I see they have a notify by email box to ask to be notified. Since you're not in a hurry.
that might work well for you.

In my case I had a chrome wheel cracked on the inner lip and found a seller on Ebay or Amazon

I am not a fan of the Camaro's styling either, but from all reports it is a helluva car to drive.

To me a Challenger is just way too big and not really competitive with either the Mustang or Camaro. It is like a 2-door Charger.

Ask how many miles I can expect to get on my 2014 Mercedes E400 Continental 245/40 X 18 in.
The Contipro Contacts have a 60,000 mile warranty. Your tread life will be affected by your driving conditions and your driving style.

Yep, got some of the fresh cool 78% stuff in there. My wife took off for a PT appointment this morning and promptly returned claiming a tire was ""flat"". We went through the ""you can't tell how much air is in a tire by looking at it"" routine and I checked all the tires again with my gauge. I was afraid that the spare was low but I don't think it's on the TPMS system in this car. I wasn't looking forward to crawling under there and lowering it to check.

The TPMS light went off shortly after she took off for the appointment."

""Your mileage may vary"" is just a huge cop out"" Could say X miles moderate driving, XX average, XXX hard driving.

But, what does 60000 mile warranty mean, even less to me. Let's say the tire goes at 54000 miles. I'll get a credit for about 10% towards the cost of a replacement tire. My tires will be about $240 each so I get a $24 credit toward a new set of tires. I think what they are insuring is that they will get me to replace my tires with their tires again.

In other words, I think the warranty is made to be longer than the tires will last, because that makes it certain you won't switch brands....which is a big problem for tire makers.

979,December 2015,stickguy,"I do know that the replacement is probably based on MSRP or some such. So you may end up paying more, especially that far out.

More useful for real premature wear out, but my one experience with this is you better have good rotation records if they are rotate able.

Also, pretty sure that the tread life warranty only applies to ones you put on later. Your MB warranty covers the ones that came on the car.

I did try to find out and more men buy trucks than women, but, after trucks Camaro is at the top of the list of cars bought by more men.

Camaro usually outsells Mustangs except when the 2015 Mustang came out last November. So, more people...mostly men, prefer a Camaro to a Mustang. Just a guess but I think the young men who buy muscle cars like the non-traditional look of the Camaro over the Mustang.

Yea, the tread life warranties are kind of like EPA mileage estimates. The Cooper CS4's I've run have an 80,000 mile treadlife warranty. I stay on top of my rotations and have gotten close to 60,000 out of a couple of sets of those, but the only way I'd EVER get close to 80K is if I did a lot of driving on perfect road surfaces, very few turns, and no weather to worry about as I was pushing the safe limits of tread depth.

I'd love to see a rating like you suggest. Going by my experience, and calling my driving fairly average, I would think 75-80% of the treadlife warranty would be a reasonable expectation for how long I could safely run a set of tires. Maybe up to 80-85% for moderate driving, 70-75% for hard driving. Does sorta sound like your mileage may vary though

Anyone else have a similar experience with how their tires have held up? This could be the start of the Edmunds Forums Tire Life Guide...heh

Its a shame that the Northstar developed a bad reputation for oil leaks and head gasket issues due to stretched head bolts. It was a smooth and nice sounding engine. My parent's 98 Aurora developed the famous oil leak that would have required the engine to be removed and resealed. Dad just put a drip pan under the car and called it a day. At 103000 miles, the ugly head gasket issue reared its ugly head. Too bad, because the car was still too nice to be junked. Thankfully they gave it to my sister and they had another engine put in and her boys have used it as their daily driver to high school.
I remember reading that the worst year was 1999 when about 22% of Northstar motors were effected. A gambler might jump at 5-1 odds but I'd never feel comfortable wondering if I was throwing snake eyes.

It was a nice engine, not real strong at low revs, but always quiet and smooth. Jump on it around 40mph and it would downshift and fly to 70 in a wink. It was easy on gas as well. I had a 2000 Intrigue GL with sunroof that I traded for the 2001 Aurora 4.0. Really liked both cars and in retrospect should have kept the Intrigue instead of trading for the Aurora.

998,December 2015,abacomike,"Just got home from my first extended ""outing"" since my two hospitalizations for my heart and stent insertion. I drove down to the Sawgrass Mills Area in Sunrise and stopped into Best Buy. They had a sale going on for Printshop software. I always buy a new calendar every year and it usually costs me $6 to $7, but since I needed some photoshop software with clip art, and they had a software DVD on sale from $49.95 to $21.99, I figured I would get the software, load it onto my PC, and print my own calendars from now on. It would pay for itself in 3-4 years. So, I bought the program and loaded it onto my HP PC. After playing with it for about an hour, I figured out how to print a simple landscape boxed calendar so I could write in my appointments, etc.

So I printed 12 sheets (12 months, obviously), clipped the pages together, and started a new calendar for next year with all my doctor, dentist and critical appointment dates entered. Sure I could use my iPhone for the appointments, but this is easier for me to have right on my desk so I can plan each week appropriately.

The drive down there and back is about 50 miles and the car performed outstandingly well. I discovered a new program in the computer system in the car that I never had on an of the other Mercedes Benz vehicles I have owned. You press one of the center, lower dash buttons with a picture of a car on it. Up on the main screen pops a picture of my car with various options in a menu. I selected ""ride and handling"" and the car is elevated showing that it was set in 100% sport suspension mode. I then swiveled the know to select 50% and selected another option called ""engine"". The image of the car enlarges and the hood opens showing the engine. Additional meters are then shown (torque measured in lb ft, fuel economy averages by minutes, oil temp and oil pressure, oil levels, etc.). Then there is a diagnostic screen that checks all fluid levels and temps of fluids. Truly an amazing feature that they added to the CLS.

When a high power model of a recent Mustang is around me when driving, I love the sound of the engine. I was passed by one coming home from ChickFilA that was GT and had horizontal stripes on the filler beween the taillights--a few years old. Great sound.

I guess it depends on type of wheel and seriousness of the damage. Some wheels need welding, or straightening, or powder coating, or re-chroming, etc. You know, like when you hit a pothole at high speed. That's not a $50 repair.

Thankfully they gave it to my sister and they had another engine put in and her boys have used it as their daily driver to high school.

However, it's beat to death - she parks on the street outside her house and it's taken quite a bit of hail damage over the years. No idea if she's had any mechanical issues with it.

my parents had a Metropolitan before I was born (I think they had it still when my 2nd sister was born. I'm 3rd) So I never got to experience the joy of riding in it.

I did learn recently that there was an advantage to it for them. Our house was a 1960 ranch, so the garage ran front to back. When we were cleaning it out to sell recently, my Dad mentioned that it was just big enough (before all the junk I had to get rid of accumulated!) to park the Metro and whatever the main car was at the time (some late 50s domestic I assume) front to back, and get them both in the garage together!

I know they had a Chevy wagon when I was little (not sure what year, maybe a 64?), though the only real memory was of laying in the back with my sisters, watching the road go by underneath through the rust hole. Yeah, the safety nannies had not taken over yet!

My real best memory was the '69 Volvo. That I can remember taking home new from the dealer. I was so excited! Ah, to be 7 again.
Ah, Metropolitans. My brother-in-law had one when I was a teenager. He would let me borrow it from time to time. I remember driving home from visiting a girl friend one night, doing about 70 mph and sandwiched in between two huge 18 wheelers. Kind of scary. His was while and gold or pale yellow and it had a penchant for the manual transmission getting hung up. You had to stop, raise the hood, and push/pull on the gear linkage to get it unhung. This would have been about 1960. I really liked that little car.

Yep. That's what we had to do. You might not like it if it was your only means of transportation, and had to get out of the car while on the shoulder of a highway in 90+ degrees to fix that transmission. Or 40 degrees in winter. Or in a sandstorm.

AND it had no heat or AC, and the main safety gear was your kneecaps.

On the other hand, it didn't break down much because it had so few parts. Ours finally died when a sailor we sold it to wrapped it around a tree one night.

Frequently, Sinatra had tremendous numbers of guests, much like Bob Hope.  So the two of them owned ""guest houses"" in the Palm Springs area which were closer to Palm Spring Int'l Airport.  But Sinatra's main, private residence was in Rancho Mirage on an estate.  Bob Hope's main residence was on a hill top overlooking highway 111 (Palm Canyon Drive) and Southwest Rancho Mirage.

Bob Hope's home is gorgeous.  I was invited there for a cocktail party back in 1991.  It's a domed house - you can't miss it, about 800-1000 feet above Palm Canyon Drive as it runs east on the southern end of Palm Springs and Rancho Mirage.

I was at Eisenhower Medical Center for some periodic blood tests and as I was walking and made a left turn toward the lab, I literally bumped right into Bob Hope who lost his balance and his valet and I grabbed him to prevent him from falling.  He said, ""...Mike, slow down - life is short!""

C'mon man, was it necessary? Blinged out Cadillacs were done so, because then their owners thought that was a sign of success (of course it was also sign of their poor taste, too. The fact that now it's a Lexus is a sign of a generation change). Now people with poor taste think it's Lexus will project their success - and poor taste to boot.

My BIL's previous Altima had an unwanted black vinyl roof and I remember seeing a Chrysler 300 in the showroom with one carrying a $3,000 price tag.

Just a little BMC B series engine in there, so you have all the power and reliability of an MGA which...ain't much. But you could put the twin SUs from the MGA on there; however you'd still have to do something about the awful handling and brakes.

I have had problems with parking lot curbs before. I didn't even know that one was there today when the tire went onto it and in looking at the sidewall I wonder how the rim ever made contact, since the run-flats have a thick ridge that extends beyond the rim.

Maybe I should just stay away from these places.

These tires are even wider than the ones that were on the E400.

Since we do not have parallel parking in 95% of South Florida, I don't have to worry about scraping the wheels on curbs.

I happened to have the Mecum auction on this afternoon. That '71 pickup was totally resto modded with something like 500HP under the hood.

There were other '71-'72 Chevy pickups that went through for much less than $30K.

Would love to get that kind of money on my dad's '70 C-10. But, I doubt it.

Buying electronics for a technophobe like me was always a chore but today was especially bad. Went to get a replacement for wife's Kindle. Which kind? She doesn't know. Just the kind ""that I can use anywhere"". Huh?

So off we go to Staples. Store is empty of customers but even more empty of anyone to help us. Wait 20 minutes for sales guy who says ""I don't know anything about Kindles and I don't think they make one you can use outside of a wifi hot spot"" Huh again? Wife pulls out her broken one and the guy looks at it. ""Oh this is 3G"". ??? ""Yeah, we don't sell those"". We leave, mouths hanging open.

I'm looking on line at Best Buy. There it is right on their web site so in order to get it to my bride right away I fight the traffic to the local mega mall where it takes me a half hour to find parking and fight my way through the crowd.

OF, there is really no reason to buy a kindle with 3g. Once you download a book you can read it any place, any time without 3g or even wifi. The only time you even need wifi is when you are connecting to Amazon to buy a book. Once it is downloaded, you should even turn wifi off while you are just reading to save battery life.

The only possible reason to have 3g on a kindle is if you suddenly get the urge to buy a book while on a picnic, driving down the road, or some place where wifi is not available.

I drove over to the casino today - they gave their elite customers a liter of Jack Daniels Sinatra 100 Select Bourbon.  Nice gift - worth $150+ if bought in a liquor store.  I don't drink, but when I do sip, I love Jack Daniels.  I'll let you know my impressions when I open the bottle - whenever that will be.

Driving home now.

They also gave me a $500 Bloomingdales gift card as a Christmas gift.  $500 doesn't go very far at Bloomingdales, but I could use a couple of new shirts and shorts and a bottle of cologne.  When I feel I can be standing and walking a little longer, I will venture over to Boca Towne Center Mall and buy myself some goodies.  But I will wait until after Christmas when they run their sales.
Let me know how the Sinatra is. I'd love to get a bottle, but $200 is a bit much for me to drop. I've got about a half a bottle of the single Barrel Jack left, I'll make it. LOL.

Well, I sure wouldn't pay $200 for a bottle of anything, to be honest.  Since I got this Sinatra 100, I've been researching it.  It is a single barrel Jack Daniels, but in honor of Sinatra's 100th birthday today.  The bottle is 90 proof, but they just released a 100 proof variety at $499.00 a liter.

So, I decided to open the bottle this evening and take a few sips out of a brandy snifter I had.  First the aroma - very oaky yet sweet smelling.  My first sip was exhilarating - a hint of vanilla sweetness as an after taste.  The second sip was utopian - even sweeter and more refreshing.  This is not the same Jack Daniels I have sipped before - this is the nectar of the gods.

I don't like it with ice or water - straight up (neat).  This is true ""sippin' whiskey""!

You are aware that I was head of a school in Rancho Mirage back in the 1990's.  I met Frank Sinatra at Walter Annenberg's Estate in Rancho Mirage back in 1991.

I'll give my Staples story.
2 weeks ago I got an online coupon for $80.00 off of an Ipad, but only if bought online. Since I wanted to get one for my wife for Christmas, it was perfect timing. So I ordered it and it came in fine. Then, in last weeks newspaper circular it was $100.00 off, in store only. Since Staples is supposed to have price match guarantee, this should be easy to get credit, right? NO. Staples online and Staples stores don't talk to each other. Their new online price was full price. What?
So, I had to go the empty Staples store in Burlington, VT, return the Ipad and then buy it again. It took 2 gallons of gas round trip to drive to the store and 20 minutes for the manager to figure out how to do the return, but I persevered and got it done. In the end, it was the principle of doing it rather than the $20.00 difference.
It think that my days of going to Staples may be over. It's always empty in the store and Amazon prime has better prices, anyway.

My son said it's been very cold at night.  From now through March, days are usually in the mid 60's to low 70's and nights in the 40's, but very dry.  I used to have a humidifier in my bedroom and would turn it on every night.  Indoor relative humidities were 3% to 5% - without a humidifier I used to get nose bleeds every morning.



Those mountains are 10,000 foot peaks.  The peak north of Palm Springs is called Mt. San Gorgonio.  The peak overlooking Palm Springs is called Mt. San Jacinto.  I-10 runs right through the gap between both peak into Banning and San Bernadino.

They have a number of nice casinos there.  At I-10 and Bob Hope Drive the Agua Caliente Tribe has a beautiful Casino on the SW corner.

And how many miles should I expect to get out of my regular E400 tires?

What kind a tires are they, driver100? I am by no means a tire expert. I just know that I liked the ride of my '08 Lancer GTS with those Pirelli P-Zero Nero's on the wheels. That car handled so well. Wish it's engine didn't blow up around the 130,000 mile mark.

I really didn't like how fast my Lancer's tires wore out - but the experts told me that since my Lancer GTS ran high-performance, low profile tires, they were made ta grip well and, because of that and some other automotive engineering obviosees, I should not expect much more than 20,000 miles on my tires. They ran me about $200 a tire, and, to a guy that spends pretty thriftily like me, that hurt. But I didn't really have a choice.

oldfarmer - well, Mitsubishi was fixin' ta send out a recall for several model year Lancer's. And they did. Here's my story about that. Mine had it's catastrophic breakdown, we traded for the '11 Kia Soul, then a recall notice shows up 3 weeks later in the mail. Mitsu's response from their telephone rep? ""You guys should've called us right then from Viva Kia/Mitsubishi in El Paso! We could've done something for you - then. But because you traded for a Kia product, we can't help you.""

""But our '08 Lancer GTS had engine failure because the serpentine belt broke prematurely, ma'am. What would you have done?"" Yes, we talked about the timing chain failing, or seizing, either first or after the serpentine belt broke. It was never fully answered as to what went first, but, the Mitsubishi recall was for the serpentine belt breaking before it should, and that is at least one of the things mechanics at two different El Paso establishments stated occurred.

So, to us, this sounded like Mitsubishi should've thrown us a bone of some value for our trouble.

""I'm really sorry, Mrs.iluvmysephia1 (my wife was on the phone with them for about 45 minutes - it was on speaker so both of us could pummel them), but you guys should've called us from the Mitsubishi dealer."" Really? All we could think of was getting some safe wheels under us to get back to Alamogordo, NM, our home, and on with our lives again. We really weren't trying to overly-dramatize anything with this case. The end result? Nothing. No compensation for you! I think we're done with Mitsubishi Motors of Japan. Or MMN America.

Back to Dodge City, KS, living, we went to our local Dodge City Goodyear dealer and got new tires yesterday. We got 4 new Cooper Starfire KR26 195/65R15's put on. Total cost was $389.57. Happy with the deal. The car drives well, better than before, in my opinion. The car wasn't really giving me any problems with anything, the tread was wearing out, so I replaced them. Anyhow, after they got done yesterday afternoon we drove around town looking for any new rental houses that might be available. We stopped at Papa Murphy's ta get a pepperoni pizza, I got out and noticed our left rear wheel was missing it's hubcap. Checked the other three, yep, they're all there.

Drove back to the Goodyear dealer and told them about what happened. ""Did you put all 4 wheel covers back on?""

""Yes, I made sure they were all back on there."" I believe him - they did. It popped off while driving on Dodge City's bumpy roads, which includes a lot of 1925 cobblestone.

So, it's off ta Wal*Mart, Autozone, or Oh! Oh! O'Reilly's tomorrow for new hubcaps for the little white monster. She's all fettered up with all her maintenance done now.

Maybe I'll check out Staples after Christmas and see if they offer any deals.
Don't know why, but the Staples in-store price is better than online. And there are conflicting interpretations of trade-in values on your old computer. One sales associate says the rebate is $150 so long as it has an intact monitor (no broken glass) and a power cord.

The electronics department manager says the rebate is up to $150. And to receive the maximum $150 rebate you must buy a new laptop with an original list price of (?). Not sure what that amount is as pricing is so fluid on these things.

Nonetheless, I am happy with my purchase decision especially with the blazing speed from my 50/50 Mbps FIOS internet connection, which is delivering closer to 60/60 Mbps. Life is good."

1118,December 2015,bwia,"Speaking of falling gas prices. Not sure where I heard it (CBS or ABC news) but the price of regular gasoline is cheaper today than it was in 1965. The price of gas then was $0.31 versus $0.27 today adjusted for inflation.

In nominal dollars, the lowest price I have seen today is $1.85 at Gulf. At these prices Tesla will have to --at least temporarily--significantly discount its Model S, and the Model X will probably have a slow start. But on the other hand now is probably a good time to buy a Tesla to position oneself for the inevitable gas price increases down the road."

Yeah, I had the gal look up the rated information on the Cooper's. I was thinking 40,000 miles and they are supposed ta be good for 40,000 miles indeed. I don't mess with snow tires or studded tires during the winter, no matter how grueling it gets in the area I happen ta be living in at the time. I always get all-season radials like this. I think it helps to have manual transmission driving in the snow, too. We just weathered a nasty snow and ice storm over Thanksgiving here in Dodge City, and the Soul with its old all-season radials (mix and match front and back - Nexen's on the front I recall) did very well. I gunned it going downhill at one point and that EBD/car's traction's gonna take over light briefly came on.

Buying electronics for a technophobe like me was always a chore but today was especially bad. Went to get a replacement for wife's Kindle. Which kind? She doesn't know. Just the kind ""that I can use anywhere"". Huh?

So off we go to Staples. Store is empty of customers but even more empty of anyone to help us. Wait 20 minutes for sales guy who says ""I don't know anything about Kindles and I don't think they make one you can use outside of a wifi hot spot"" Huh again? Wife pulls out her broken one and the guy looks at it. ""Oh this is 3G"". ??? ""Yeah, we don't sell those"". We leave, mouths hanging open.

I'm looking on line at Best Buy. There it is right on their web site so in order to get it to my bride right away I fight the traffic to the local mega mall where it takes me a half hour to find parking and fight my way through the crowd. It's a mad house at Best Buy. Finally I hear ""can I help you?"" I ask where I can find Kindles. ""Right behind you"" he says. Yeah! Success! I ask to see one with 3G. ""Oh we don't have them in the store, try online""

X2.

Buy it at amazon. if you are a prime member, shipped to you in 2 business days. You can pay extra for quick shipping. Only problem is now they charge sales tax on purchases by Ohio residents thanks to our goofball governor negotiating with them to do that as part of setting up a warehouse in Ohio or offices or some type. So they have a presence in Ohio and must charge sales tax to residents.

I love buying from Amazon and Ebay. Amazon has never let me down. When something didn't get delivered in a reasonable time and tracking didn't work right, they made it right based on my email comments about the problem with tracking on their new shipping techniques.

Mike, that VIP list is one I'd like to be on given their generosity. Do you gamble there a lot? I've not heard you mention it much.

Speaking of booze, I have a rather large scotch whisky collection - not buying much any more, as I went through it a while ago and realized I have more than I will ever drink myself, and a lot of it is pricey stuff that you don't want to break out while just watching a football game on TV or whatever. My doctor was alarmed the last time I was to see her when I mentioned it to her - I guess she thought I was guzzling it every night. I ration myself.

Funny story on the medical front. I had a regularly scheduled appointment with my doctor on Thursday, just to get prescriptions renewed and routine checks. She had me get blood and urine samples analyzed a month or so ago and the results were in. She was rattling off all these thing - everything good, normal, whatever. When she was done she said ""You're in great shape!"" with a big smile. I just looked at her. ""You've got to be kidding"" I said. ""Well, for someone your age with your medical history, you are"", she said. ""All you need is a girlfriend. I can give you some Viagra or whatever if that's what it takes."" I was astounded. Never had a woman offer me Viagra before! I had a good laugh over it.

I'm sure this exists on other brands in some form, but the Cooper tires we have also have a small square in the tread. Each side of the square is a different depth, so as the tire wears, the square will start to lose sides one at a time. The last side of the square turns into an exclamation point to let you know, HEY, it's time!

1157,December 2015,henryn,"Speaking of tires, I just bought a new set of Michelins for my 2006 DTS. The car only has 38k miles, and the tread looked good, but the left front has been leaking for a while now, and last Saturday I discovered a small bulge in the sidewall. 3 of the 4 tires are original equipment Goodyear Eagles, now 9 years old going for 10.

I decided to just bite the bullet and put on a new set of Michelin Defenders. I called around, Discount Tire was at $823, and the Firestone just down the street was at $901, and the manager threw in a front end alignment. Firestone being more convenient (2 blocks from my house), I went with them. Big mistake.

I get the car home, and check the tire pressures via the DIC and the TPMS. 3 of the 4 tires are between 32 and 34 pounds, the left rear is at 38. Really?

So I get out my digital tire gauge (which I have cross checked against 2 analog tire gauges), and start adjusting tire pressures. Turns out it is the left front that is at 38, not the left rear, indicating that Firestone moved wheels around and did not reset the TPMS systems.

So I go back to Firestone, and ask them to reset the TPMS. “No, problem, Mr. Nettles, we’re sorry to have overlooked that.” Ten minutes later, I’m back in my car and staring at a warning light on the dash for underinflated tires. Seriously? I drive the two blocks to my house, and find that all 4 tires are inflated to 26 pounds.

So straight back to Firestone. The employee who “reset” my TPMS comes out, wants to know the problem, I tell him. He gives me attitude, whips out his tire gauge and shows me the reading of 30 pounds. I go in the store, get the manager, have him come out and check the tire pressure. 26 pounds, all 4 corners. So much for Firestone, I don’t care how convenient they are. If they can’t manage to air up tires correctly, then …

As noted in the CCBA thread, yesterday was my birthday. My step-daughter gave me a new watch as a birthday gift.

Turns out there was a bit of a back story to the purchase - my daughter has pretty decent tastes, but doesn't always understand economics.

When she did her search through Amazon, she wanted to get me a ""James Bond watch"". Price was no object - turns out the Omega watch she found (""Spectre"" limited edition?) retailed for $6K.

I don't think she realized that watches can retail for that much money ..

Turns out, price is an object. I got a very nice chronograph that was, I'm sure, much, much less than $6K.

She's a good kid.

Well happy birthday.

I took a look at Amazon and that watch was $6,190 down from $7,350

My guess if it wasn't a ""limited edition"" Spectre watch it would be half that price or less.

I was doing my afternoon pick up at the high school yesterday and a group of girls were standing just outside my bus. They were discussing sex education (and sex in general) and the talk was incredibly graphic. This ain't your grandma's generation. The gross way that referred to other girls was shocking.

In more pleasant news, I past a MB SL400 today and thought it was a really sharp looking car.

As you know, I was a school principal and private school headmaster for over 25 years.  In Middle School and High School, the girls are as graphic about sex as the boys.  No, this isn't even our generation, let alone grandmother's generation.

As for the MB SL400, it has the same engine as my CLS400 (V6 3.0 L twin turbo) which generates 329 hp and 354 lb ft of torque.  329 hp is more than enough power for my new car but the big advantage is 20/30 mpg city/highway.  The V8 is unnecessary (402 hp) especially when you give up 20% fuel economy over the turbo V6.

Besides, when would I ever need 402 hp? My 2014 CLS550 has the V8 and was over-powered IMHO.

But that SL400 is on beautiful car, to be sure!

The X3 isn't much of an off road vehicle at all. It is an SAV, Sports Activity Vehicle as opposed to SUV - Sports Utility Vehicle. That means you can use it to carry your sports gear, like skis or bike, but not for off-roading. The Jeep is definitely good for off roading, and in the 10 years I had my Jeeps I drove them off road once.
Thanks for the reply, the reason I asked is that I have a few friends with Jeeps that wouldn't think twice about taking their Jeeps over some serious off road crap. But the few ""luxury SUV"" owners I know cringe when they go over a pebble on a paved street.

While Jeeps may not be the best for paved roads but they are one of the best for when you run out of road.

I know a group of people who finished restoring a WWII Jeep and did some mighty painstaking research on the regs for them, right down to the position of the slots on the screws (vertical so that water runs down them).

About 12 years ago when I started working for my Dad, I cut my thumb really bad on a piece of galvanized sheet metal. Once I realized the bleeding wouldn't stop, I knew I needed stitches.

I went to a hospital here in The Bronx (bad neighborhood) and was seen relatively quickly. I was asked A LOT of questions (with my finger still gushing blood): Are you an IV drug user? Do you have HIV or AIDS? 2 interns or residents came to clean out my cut with a plastic syringe filled with saline. He was a skinny Asian kid who had a lot of trouble getting the saline to come out. So he pushed with 2 thumbs. The saline shot out on to my finger and ricocheted on to the patient 2 beds away from me (drenching him with my blood).

The same guy who couldn't work the saline syringe came back to stitch me up. I said to him, I don't know who you think you are but dont come any closer to me. You get me an attending physician, preferably the head of general surgery or a plastic surgeon.
I was a Hospital Corpsman in the service and more than capable of suturing. One day we had a Lieutenant come in with a pretty bad cut on his arm that needed stitches. This Lieutenant was not going to let me, a mere Corpsman, suture him up and demanded that a doctor do the sutures. Well I went and got the Watch Captain and told him what the situation was and he tried to talk to this lieutenant to no avail. So we got the Duty Medical Officer who was a Captain, he came in pointed to me and told the Lieutenant that I was qualified to do the suturing and would be doing the suturing and ordered the Lieutenant to like it.

Had to do a presentation for driving simulators to American Honda, yesterday. Not the plant in Marysville, though. I had to go to their R&D facility in Raymond, OH (didn't even know there was such a city).

Anyway, not thinking my Caddy would be well received, and given my wife's Accord needed to be driven, I'm taking the Accord. Side note...with all due respect to Kirstie and Karen here at Edmunds, why is it that females seem to be able to junk up the interior of a car with no rhyme nor reason as to the junk they accumulate in their cars? My wife's was a mess.

First things first, I cleaned out her car and dumped everything in the trunk (which was also ""junky"") so I at least was relatively comfortable while driving. Filled it up. Off I went.

There is only a little bit of interstate I had to negotiate. The rest of the trip (two hours one way) was twisty backroads. I always enjoy those drives. I get to see parts of my state that I rarely, if ever, get to see. Easy to forget that once you get out of Ohio's big cities, it's essentially still a farming community. And, I saw plenty of those, with a few ""settlements"" along the way that could easily be named Mayberry.

i had forgotten what a joy Honda products are to drive. The Accord steers very well. The steering is well weighted and communicative. It certainly handled the twisty backroads well....to the point where I actually used the shift paddles on the steering wheel. That seems silly given the Accord has a CVT, but it does a very credible immitation of a ""regular"" automatic. The shift paddles changed trans ratios nearly instantaneously. Brakes were great.

Not particularly quick (with the 4 cyl) and the engine wasn't nearly as refined as I remember Honda 4 cyls being, but certainly acceptable.

It was a fun drive. Honda/Acura doesn't do any one thing the best. It does everything well, however.

A little too much engine and suspension noise, and it crashed on some bigger pavement breaks. But, I'm used to the Caddy. So, probably not fair.

One sales story, one no-sale story...

1. Sales story- My wonderful bride convinced me to buy the watch I had been lusting after: A Tag Heuer Formula 1 McLaren Limited Edition- 1 of 5000. Only fitting, as when we got married almost 30 years ago she gave me a Heuer 1000 diving watch as a wedding present.
As noted in the CCBA thread, yesterday was my birthday. My step-daughter gave me a new watch as a birthday gift.

Turns out there was a bit of a back story to the purchase - my daughter has pretty decent tastes, but doesn't always understand economics.

When she did her search through Amazon, she wanted to get me a ""James Bond watch"". Price was no object - turns out the Omega watch she found (""Spectre"" limited edition?) retailed for $6K.

I don't think she realized that watches can retail for that much money ..

Turns out, price is an object. I got a very nice chronograph that was, I'm sure, much, much less than $6K.

She's a good kid.

That's what my doctors thought.  

Blood pressure still till low when I stand according to the nurse that was here earlier.  She told me to space my blood pressure meds better - in other words don't take the ""every twelve hour"" drugs at 6:00 and 6:00, but take one at 11:00 and 11:00 and another at 9:00 and 9:00.

Would anyone care to comment on what you would do in this case? This happened in our semi gated community in Florida.

We were walking our dog on one of the streets in the complex and we saw a car backing up at full speed on the street. The car backed up and went over the lawn and over the cement curb. It looked like a scene from a movie, Fast and Furious.

I thought the driver would stop to assess any damage, but the driver put the car in drive and floored the car to a speed of between 50 and 60 mph (posted speed limit is 15 mph).
The car was a Toyota.

1227,December 2015,graphicguy,"firefighter...couldn't agree more about having an ""advocate"" when in a hospital. Given I was 5 hours away from anyone (sent my son home) when I had my event, Northwestern, which is a great hospital, thought they would use me as a guinea pig.

Aside from the hourly blood drawing, they also wanted to do a full body CAT scan. Nobody told them ""no"", and no one asked me. They just wheeled me into the scanner. After about 20 minutes of this, and being a bit claustrophobic, I finally had to yell loud enough to the technician in the other room to get me out of their ""tube"".

After complaining, they said they didn't think I'd mind and given they were also a teaching hospital, they thought it would be good to enter my physical malady and subsequent recovery into their database. Again, no one asked me if it was OK, which I told the Chief of Cardiology, when I finally got him rounded up to talk to me.

Since they did not get my prior consent, either verbally and even in writing, they realized their faux pas, and removed any co-pays for my stay.....which was a significant amount.

Ah, memories of my 2 weeks in hospital at the end of '09. I had a very hard time getting adjusted to their schedule. Checking you at 2AM to see if you were asleep which meant turning on the lights and waking you up! Being awakened very early for daily blood collection before breakfast. Then just sitting around in bed or in a chair most of the day, interrupted by IVs and various other things they did to you. Lunch delivered at 11AM. You got excited about that until you lifted the lid and saw it. Lights out at 10PM! Then noise in the halls until midnight to keep you from sleeping. Good times!

They must have been twins - that doctor (cardiologist) looked and smelled more like a funeral director.  I had a great uncle who was a funeral director at Riverside Funeral Homes on Amsterdam Avenue and Central Park West (NYC).  Even dressed in casual clothes, you knew he was a funeral director.  6'2"" tall, slim, completely bald, and the look of the Angel of Death.  But I loved him dearly.  He had a wry sense of humor.  He arranged the funeral of Fanny Brice (from the movie ""Fanny"").

When he passed away, we had his body flown to the Amsterdam Avenue Funeral Home - all the employees came to see him (embalmers, funeral directors, hearse drivers, limo drivers, etc).  He was loved by everyone.

BTW - I failed the blood pressure test (sitting and standing).  Blood pressure is too low.  Now I have to deal with the doctors who wanted to discharge me today.

At 4:00 AM this morning, this old man (had to be 90 years old) dressed in a grey suit, pink shirt and lilac tie and smelled like he had broken a bottle of cheap cologne all over himself, comes into my hospital room.  He introduced himself as Dr. Gillespie and that he was a cardiologist covering for my cardiologist.  He told me that my tests were negative but that I had some residual effects from my heart attack and it would take a few weeks before I felt better.
That reminds me of what happened to me when I first was diagnosed with heart problems around 1990 or '91. I complained to my family doctor about symptoms and he sent me to a specialist. This guy wasn't just a cardiologist but some kind of internal medicine specialist. I remember thinking as he examined me that he smelled kind of odd but I couldn't place it at first. His office had a stress test treadmill that he hooked me up to and I did the routine. He went into his office and told me to join him once I cleaned up and got dressed.

He was an older, white-haired gruff sort of fellow, not very friendly, and when I went into his office he was smoking a pipe and the office was full of smoke. That was the smell I picked up, flavored pipe tobacco. ""You've got coronary artery disease"" he said, and handed me a prescription for some pills. That was it, no follow-up, no advice, nothing, very perfunctory. I was furious, upset and confused at the same time given I was 33 and figured it was some other problem. I went back to my doctor a few days later and complained about this guy, who failed to impress me much. He sent me to a real cardiologist who confirmed the diagnosis but who was much more helpful. Takes all kinds, I guess.

Do you have HIV or AIDS? 2 interns or residents came to clean out my cut with a plastic syringe filled with saline. He was a skinny Asian kid who had a lot of trouble getting the saline to come out. So he pushed with 2 thumbs. The saline shot out on to my finger and ricocheted on to the patient 2 beds away from me (drenching him with my blood).

The same guy who couldn't work the saline syringe came back to stitch me up. I said to him, I don't know who you think you are but dont come any closer to me. You get me an attending physician, preferably the head of general surgery or a plastic surgeon.

The radio display would light up STEREO in the 70 Cadillac and 72 Cutlass when tuned into a radio station that broadcasted in stereo. The price difference between a standard AM/FM radio and stereo was pretty steep. I guess they weren't true stereo as you point out. I do remember that in 73 dad was looking to replace his 71 Pontiac Catalina company car for another Catalina. He looked all over the lot to find a Catalina with the stereo upgrade. He only found one which he bought. When his boss approved the purchase his boss called out to dad that dad had to buy the one with the 'expensive' radio.

We were walking our dog on one of the streets in the complex and we saw a car backing up at full speed on the street. The car backed up and went over the lawn and over the cement curb. It looked like a scene from a movie, Fast and Furious.

I thought the driver would stop to assess any damage, but the driver put the car in drive and floored the car to a speed of between 50 and 60 mph (posted speed limit is 15 mph). He went over another curb and up onto the lawn coming close to the house on the curve.

We were on the other side of the street and ran up the side road in case he cut across that lawn as well. If someone was walking OR if we were walking on the other side of the street we would have been hit! 3 people witnessed the whole thing.

The car was a Toyota. There were several witnesses who were shocked by what they saw, and believe this person is a danger to the community.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wrote this to the president of the board and to our almost useless management company. I have heard from a source they plan on finding a way to slow down traffic in the complex, maybe put in speed bumps.

My point is this is not just a case of speeding, this is a case of reckless driving and endangering residents. I told the board that I put my experience in writing because if something happens to me and they do not act they are being negligent (and I will sue their butts off).

I am thinking if the board doesn't act then I will at least report the incident to the police, so they will have a record of it. I'd rather not do this because I don't want this loose canon trying to get revenge.

Apparently this guy rents the unit and we are pretty certain he had a big argument with his partner and he got mad and took off - probably DUI.

1279,December 2015,28firefighter,"As someone with a myriad of health issues with more hospital stays than I care to admit for someone under 30, I can tell you that the single most important thing for me when I am in the hospital is to have someone who can advocate for me. Whether it's a family member, a friend or health aid, it can truly save your life. 

There are two primary reasons. First, most of the major hospitals are teaching hospitals. Your first line in those places are interns and residents. They need to learn, but you need someone who can stop the learning train if it's going the wrong way and be a constant voice on your behalf. Second, most units are understaffed and the patient:nurse ratio is very high. Having someone to handle knucklehead stuff (read: ice chips, jello, pillow adjustments) means nurses are able to focus on you for truly medical issues.

Short story for you: When I was 20 I was admitted to the hospital for a flare-up of my chronic illness.  This was when I was away at school with no family around. It was urgent and I needed several imaging studies run immediately to ensure I wasn't in need of emergency surgery. However, my pain was so bad, they gave me pain meds which put me out of it. They left me in a hallway basically forgot about me for at least 2-3 hours - critical time. When I woke up, my best friend (who happens to be an ER nurse) had found me and had called my attending and was tearing into the interns for not rushing me for the imaging studies and additional tests. Without her being there, I might have laid in the ER like a corpse for hours without care. It's nothing personal I realize, but still potentially disastrous.  I was/am very lucky that she came when she did - she saved me from surgery. 

Fun fact, when I was finally let out a few days later, my car had been towed because someone put up a temporary no parking sign.

Automotive News
December 7, 2015 - 12:01 am ET

WASHINGTON -- Volkswagen brand dealers are bracing for another month of pain after seeing U.S. sales tumble 25 percent in November.

The question now: When will it end?

VW withstood the initial fallout of its diesel emissions scandal, holding sales flat in October, the first full month after revelations of its cheating. Dealers, too, seemed hopeful they'd be able to sell their way through the crisis with the help of emergency aid from the factory, help that earned VW of America CEO Michael Horn a standing ovation at VW's national dealer meeting.

But as Volkswagen drifts into a third month of a seemingly unbound scandal, that tone is changing and dealer frustrations are bubbling to the surface. The absence of a ready-to-go fix, plus continuing inventory shortages and the prospect of more new-car sales pain, is stirring angst and even anger in VW's dealer network.

""This thing isn't getting better with time,"" said Alan Brown, co-owner of two Hendrick Volkswagen dealerships in suburban Dallas and chairman of VW's dealer council. ""We don't have a fix. We don't have a timeline."" The unknown, he added, is ""what makes the anxiety of this even worse.""

Guarantee gone

Undermining dealer faith is the drip-drip of confusing signals from Germany, none of them reassuring.

Volkswagen's internal probe has yet to reveal details about the scandal's origins or who was involved. Meanwhile, the churn of German executives continues, with Ulrich Hackenberg leaving his post as Audi's chief engineer last week after his reported suspension in the scandal's wake.

Stateside, VW is awaiting regulatory approval on its plan to get its diesels back into compliance -- a plan filed just hours before a California deadline on Nov. 20. In a statement to Automotive News, Horn said VW continues to cooperate with regulators and is working ""as quickly as possible"" to get a fix in place.

Meanwhile, an information vacuum has put the value of affected VW diesels under a cloud of uncertainty. Competing brands' dealers won't accept the used TDIs on trade, and VW dealers feel pressure to absorb them at depressed prices to reflect their more than 15 percent price drop at auctions since the scandal.

A VW offer to repurchase used TDIs from dealers at guaranteed pre-crisis prices turned out to be a one-time program for vehicles in stock as of Oct. 22, and customers looking to unload their TDIs now are seeing offers that leave them ""very frustrated,"" Brown said.

""It's scaring [dealers] because we don't know how long we're going to sit on the cars,"" Brown said.

Meanwhile, low inventories of salable gasoline vehicles could continue to hamper sales.

Fred Emich, general manager of Emich Volkswagen in Denver, says he began December with just two Tiguan crossovers among his vehicles in stock, though he has more than 40 on the way. Overall, inventories are slightly better than last month, when limited product drove away deals despite showroom traffic being on a par with October, he said.

""You're selling from empty shelves,"" Emich said.

Steve Kalafer, owner of the 17-franchise Flemington Car & Truck Country, says his VW store in Flemington, N.J., has fewer than 50 salable new VWs in stock, compared with the more than 100 he would normally stock ahead of the year-end sales push. His December sales prospects look ""bleak,"" he said.

""We would be hopeful that Volkswagen would ship these cars on overtime,"" Kalafer said, but during the holiday season, ""the auto business from the manufacturer side basically shuts down.""

'Crossed off the list'

VW's 25 percent November decline was the steepest for the VW brand since the start of the Great Recession. One reason for the falloff: VW scaled back the hefty incentives that fueled October demand. The $2,000 cash bonus for returning VW owners in October has been reduced to $1,000 to $1,500 depending on the model.

Emich says he hasn't sold any 2016 Passats since his shipments of the re-engineered car began arriving last month.

""The 2016 Passat, unfortunately, is missing some incentives,"" Emich said. ""It's essentially a face-lifted car that they're treating like a redesigned or new model.""

Horn urged patience. ""In October, Volkswagen presented plans for continued dealer support at the national dealer meeting,"" he said in his statement. ""We remain committed to supporting our dealers.""

Brown, the dealer council chairman, said that to keep and attract customers, Horn should demand enough money from VW headquarters in Germany to offer new-car deals that are the best in the industry.

""We cannot be arrogant and higher priced,"" he said.

Kalafer says VW is already being ""crossed off the list"" by customers who no longer trust the company.

""Volkswagen of America has their head in the sand,"" Kalafer said. ""It's not just going to be another incentive or another bonus that gets Volkswagen out of this. It's going to be the dealers who get Volkswagen out of this. The reputation of Volkswagen is spiraling towards worthlessness.""

The reader comments at the end are also interesting, with several pointing out the German culture as being a part of VW's woes here. If VW loses the hearts and minds of their dealers, they are really in trouble.

1295,December 2015,imidazol97,"I found this comment after the article from a reader especially stinging to the virtual image of VW's quality: ""And Volkswagen is losing the China market that they've come so much to depend on. Though the diesel scandal was minimal in China, the consumers there, burned by shoddy (cheap) DSG and rear axle engineering, has been all ears about the deceit surrounding the global dieselgate scandal.""

We'll see if the MSM supports VW's resurrection or if they pan the process with negatives.

More:

""I don't think VW will ever recover 100% from this. Maybe 60 to 70% tops. Nobody at VW knows what to do,because they are still uncovering more BS. VW has gotten to big,to many name plates and to many mouths to feed. They need to sell off some name plates for money they are going to need.""

With a 3-tone paint job no less!

Our neighbors had a Vista Cruiser just like this one, same color but without the white roof. They had it for years. I got to ride in it from time to time, don't remember if it had the third seat. I think the third seat was an option, or they always had it folded down.

That is also the same color as my parent's 69 98 LS sedan. Only it had a black vinyl roof and black cloth interior. I found that car to be optioned up somewhat oddly. It had power windows and 6 way power seat, tilt/telescope wheel with rim blow horn, a/c, am radio, Olds factory 8 track stereo, remote trunk release. Yet no power locks, AM radio no FM (really?) no cruise control or rear window defogger. Dad bought it used in 71 to replace mom's 63 Olds Dynamic 88. The three of us kids loved the 98--it was huge inside and we were not used the luxury of the 98.

One thing I always thought was strange, is in most GM cars at the time, if you got the AM/FM stereo, or 8 track it only had a front and rear speaker. True stereo should have been left and right speakers, not front and rear. As such the stereo imaging was not correct. We had that in both our 69 98 and mom's 72 Cutlass. I know that Cadillac offered a 4 speaker stereo at this time, but lesser GM cars not so much. My 70 Cadillac DeVille convertible had 4 factory stereo speakers, 2 up front, 2 in the rear.

85 Charger was actually a pretty smart looking little car in it's day.


Talking about Omni's, Horizons, reminds me of Vegas, Falcons, Citations, Cimmerons, and a host of other cars that maybe helped the upstart foreign car makers to make inroads into North America.

Anyone remember in the late 70s Ford wanted to make a more gas efficient car, so they made a smaller LTD called an LTD II. It was still enormous and heavy, but was supposed to be more fuel efficient. It had about all the worst styling cues any car could have including excess chrome and lots of lines and creases....plus enormous front end with not much interior room.


</Wasn't the LTD II just a face lifted Gran Torino? I think it was on the same platform. A weak effort at best.

His PT involves slowly getting into an exercise and low fat diet.

Twice the cool factor. Like them both. Big ups. When did you add them to the fleet? Can we add them to the punch list this year?
VW purchased July 28, 2015, and the Camaro purchased August 2015. The Camaro purchase came after our Crossfire died at the top of an interstate off-ramp. Cost to repair was going to be close the the vehicle's value, and having owned it (purchased used) for 7+ years, it was time for something else.

After trading in the Crossfire, a good friend of ours was dismayed because he said he would have wanted it. He ended up working with the dealership to purchase it back from them (still broken) for what they gave us on trade-in. That's still a work in progress, but we hope he can get it running again soon.

On the subject of Mustangs, older Mustangs with the older V6 engines. Back around 2008 or 2009 I purchased a used Mustang GT convertible. It was a 2001 Model, with the 4.6L V8 engine. It was in beautiful, garage kept condition, and had an aftermarket exhaust that made it sound really loud and tough. My wife (now ex) drove me over to pick it up, and on the way home I was getting frisky until my ex got impatient and blew the doors off my new Mustang GT with her Passat 2.0T. Rather embarrassing, actually.

I didn’t keep that car for very long.

Jeep Liberty with the 3.7L engine – back about 2 years ago, a friend had the engine go out on her Liberty. I advised her to junk it, but she didn’t listen, spent nearly $5k on a rebuilt engine for a car that was worth about half that (high mileage, not that clean).

That reminds me, if anyone cares to comment. The old Chrysler slant 6 engines were supposed to last forever....and I recall Chrysler used it for many cars. It was a good engine in the Dart and Scamp, and other Chryslers, and those were good cars.

Then they updated to bring out the Volare and Aspens and those cars were disasters. Completely unreliable. What went wrong?



My recollection of early 70s cars was that they all had drivability problems and terrible build quality. The Volare got Chrysler in trouble with the NYS Attorney General who sued them for fenders that rusted. I remember because I used the AG's action as a club when Chrysler was slow to fix a problem with my Omni.

Never understood the upset about rusting fenders since they all did that in the days when inner fenders were for luxury cars only. It was actually kind of cool to see rooster tails erupting through the front fenders on rainy days.


Those were dark days for many cars as they were forced to install emission controls that those engines were never designed for. The slant sixes seemed to be especially affected by this. Thjey didn't ""break"" they just ran poorly. Even before the smog controls got so cumbersone, they always seemed to have trouble passing emission tests. they also weren't known for getting great mileage.

Still, back in the time when most engines were shot before 100,000, a slant six was capable of going twice than many miles before needing an overhaul."

I can relate to both of the recently posted pics. My parents got a new 1981 Malibu Classic Estate wagon in the same color scheme as the LeMans you posted, also with a 305 but had the Chevy ""rally"" wheels that had a center cap and trim rings (anybody remember those?)

And the LTD II reminded me of my first car, a 1974 Gran Torino. No Clint Eastwood version for me though, as mine was a hideous lime green color 4-door with a dark green vinyl interior. Not a bad first car, though 9 mpg out of the 351 Cleveland was about as good as it got. Fortunately, gas in Houston was relatively cheap at the time (in 1986 it was well under a buck a gallon). The LTD II was just a disguised Torino that Ford let linger on for a couple of years, also nearly identical to the Thunderbird and Cougar of the time. The redesigned Granada, itself just a tarted up Fairmont, replaced the LTD II I believe, and then Ford did it all over again by rebadging that car as the LTD in 1983 when the big one was renamed the LTD Crown Victoria. My Grandparents had one of the ""little"" LTDs, a 1983 wagon that wasn't a bad ride with the 3.8 V6.

That's odd that your Mustang was slower than a VW. It had 260hp. Must have been the rear end. My Mark VIII with the 4 valve 4.6L puts out 280hp. but isn't that fast off the line because it has a 3.09 rear end. The LSC model had a 3.73 rear and was a screamer I hear. Maybe your Stang was built for economy.

My SIL's Jeep is worth $4-5k according to the books. Getting even a used motor into it just doesn't seem worth it. I suggested trying to sell it to a mechanic for $1000 who might be able to get a motor into it and sell it.

So, finally made it home late last night from a marathon set of business that took me from Cincinnati, to Orlando, to Denver in the span of 4 days.

Last car I rented in Denver was a Jeep Grand Cherokee. I'm noticing that the more I rent from Hertz, the more likely they are to put me in a ""step up"" model for the price of the company preferred ""compact"".

Anyway, pretty darned impressed with the JGC. I'll assume mine was a base model as it wasn't all leathered up and there were plenty of hard plastics all around. But, the V6 Pentastar motor moved it smartly and didn't sound like a John Deere knock off. Assuming the trans was Chrysler's 9 speed, it performed admirably. No hunting and searching, mostly shifting without me noticing it much. And, it kicked down a cog or two when I wanted it to.

Seats were comfortable, and again, I think they were the base seats. Suspension was solid, even though it was clear I was driving a relatively heavy vehicle. It did push through the corners, but not as badly as I expected.

The ride and handling is what I'd call giving a very solid feeling. No thumps, twists, skips, just solid feeling overall pavement types. Base ""uconnect"" was simple and easy to use, especially given I had never used such a system....EVER! Screen didn't have Nav and was small, but connecting my phone was easy. Speedo, tach etc were clear and easy to read, even with sunglasses. Might have even been a digital number. Good information shown between the speedo and tach....MPG, tire pressure, DTE, radio station, etc.

For the 3 days I had it, and 1/2 tank gas, I got 22 MPG in mixed driving, and I wasn't easy on it.

Pretty impressive. Last real SUV I had driven was my much loved Tahoe, but that was a decade old. If I were in the market for a luxury SUV and didn't need a huge one, I'd put the JGC as a ""must consider"" with the likely candidates from Lexus, Acura, etc.

Slant 6 automatic - wife and I were pretty happy to have that rig when we got it. The Fairlane's motor was smoking (literally). And coming in the cabin!

From the '73 Plymouth Gold Duster I bought a 1986 Mercury Lynx station wagon. That car blew a head gasket and a timing belt. I let the 60,000 miles roll over and gain another thousand or so - the car broke down about a block from our north Everett, WA, house! The Lynx SW stayed with us for about 5 years, actually, before I became enamored with the '94 Ford Escort SW. Bought that in the spring of '94. And the story continues on and on.

My Dad had a Horizon and my mom it's sportier cousin an 85 Dodge Charger.  I remember them both being new and constantly broken.  My dad's was a stick and moms auto.  My moms even needed a head gasket under warranty and both of them the A/C died at least once .   I believe both of the were the 2.2 L.

  My dad got rid of his early on and had a Shelby Charger and then an 87 Shadow ES turbo (anyone remember those?).  Mom held onto the Charger until 93 or so when my Stepdad got her a 92 el strippo Caravan (which for some reason was bulletproof).  
85 Charger was actually a pretty smart looking little car in it's day.


Talking about Omni's, Horizons, reminds me of Vegas, Falcons, Citations, Cimmerons, and a host of other cars that maybe helped the upstart foreign car makers to make inroads into North America.

Anyone remember in the late 70s Ford wanted to make a more gas efficient car, so they made a smaller LTD called an LTD II. It was still enormous and heavy, but was supposed to be more fuel efficient. It had about all the worst styling cues any car could have including excess chrome and lots of lines and creases....plus enormous front end with not much interior room.

I know I had a terrible time after my surgery finding the right cardiac drug that would work to regulate my heartbeat. Some didn't do anything at all for it, while others worked too well. I was on one that had my resting heartbeat at 40 or less and BP was dangerously low. The good news is that I no longer get PVCs very often whereas they used to be fairly common. PVCs can lead to lowered BP so I think this is just a matter of getting the meds dialed in. More of a tune-up than an oil-change.

I well remember that in September of 1977, Dad really wanted to get out of his '75 Hornet Sportabout. Not exactly sure why, as I thought it wasn't a bad car. Maybe it needed some investment in tires and brakes or some such. It didn't take much for him back then to swap cars. He would have fit right in here.

Anyway, I well remember him taking Mom and myself to the dealers. I think he was turned off AMC so we didn't go to that dealer. He probably could have been convinced to look at Volvo wagons but they were pretty pricey. So we went to the big 3 dealers.

Drove a blue metallic Aspen SE wagon, nice enough, but neither of them liked it for whatever reason. GM didn't have anything but the brochure for the soon to be introduced LeMans wagon. And Ford didn't have either the new Fairmont wagon or even a brochure, but they did have a '77 LTD II Squire, dark red with woodgrain outside, red inside, that I remember driving. It was typical Ford of that era, numb steering, soft suspension, quiet and smooth. But it was really big, and had those battering-ram bumpers with body fillers big enough to set a dinner table setting on. They liked it well enough - I think they actually liked all the chrome and stuff outside - but coming out of the Sportabout it was just too big.

He ended up buying a Grand LeMans Safari sight unseen for delivery on introduction day.

Chrysler and GM did go into bankruptcy, chapter 11, restructure of debt. If you are suggesting that Chapter 7, which is liquidation, would have allowed GM or Chrysler to survive, all I can say is would you buy a car from a liquidated company? One doesn't see a new Pontiac or Oldsmobile driving around. And even if you did, how can a company continue after selling off most of its infrastructure? GM and Chrysler would have had to become something else, possibly a small branch of a Japanese or German company, making parts or some such.
No I mean a proper Chapter 11, one where the government doesn't take ownership of a majority stake in the company. GM and Chrysler had a Chapter 11 in name only. What they had was more of a government takeover where the government mandated several things. In a true Chapter 11 the courts would have mediated a restructure of debts.

Last car I rented in Denver was a Jeep Grand Cherokee. I'm noticing that the more I rent from Hertz, the more likely they are to put me in a ""step up"" model for the price of the company preferred ""compact"".

Anyway, pretty darned impressed with the JGC. I'll assume mine was a base model as it wasn't all leathered up and there were plenty of hard plastics all around. But, the V6 Pentastar motor moved it smartly and didn't sound like a John Deere knock off. Assuming the trans was Chrysler's 9 speed, it performed admirably. No hunting and searching, mostly shifting without me noticing it much. And, it kicked down a cog or two when I wanted it to.

Seats were comfortable, and again, I think they were the base seats. Suspension was solid, even though it was clear I was driving a relatively heavy vehicle. It did push through the corners, but not as badly as I expected.

The ride and handling is what I'd call giving a very solid feeling. No thumps, twists, skips, just solid feeling overall pavement types. Base ""uconnect"" was simple and easy to use, especially given I had never used such a system....EVER! Screen didn't have Nav and was small, but connecting my phone was easy. Speedo, tach etc were clear and easy to read, even with sunglasses. Might have even been a digital number. Good information shown between the speedo and tach....MPG, tire pressure, DTE, radio station, etc.

For the 3 days I had it, and 1/2 tank gas, I got 22 MPG in mixed driving, and I wasn't easy on it.

Unless tjc78 met his wife after 2005 wasn't the V6 Mustang powered by that unreliable Ford 3.8L?

This brings up a question, would you do any serious off roading with the X3?
The X3 isn't much of an off road vehicle at all. It is an SAV, Sports Activity Vehicle as opposed to SUV - Sports Utility Vehicle. That means you can use it to carry your sports gear, like skis or bike, but not for off-roading. The Jeep is definitely good for off roading, and in the 10 years I had my Jeeps I drove them off road once.

There was snow on the ground, we were trying to find a small church out in the country, for a funeral, realized we were going the wrong way, turned into what I thought was a driveway but it was a huge pile of snow that accumulated in the ditch. Took awhile but the Jeep got out of it - probably one of the few vehicles that would have done it....and we got to the funeral just at the last moment.

Since then, I have had a lot of respect for Jeeps.

Their current repair track record isn't great, but, I think they got the transmission problems sorted out.....and I think they may actually hold up pretty well over the long term.

My recollection of early 70s cars was that they all had drivability problems and terrible build quality. The Volare got Chrysler in trouble with the NYS Attorney General who sued them for fenders that rusted. I remember because I used the AG's action as a club when Chrysler was slow to fix a problem with my Omni.

Never understood the upset about rusting fenders since they all did that in the days when inner fenders were for luxury cars only. It was actually kind of cool to see rooster tails erupting through the front fenders on rainy days.

A wee bit. I bought mine on a whim off Craigslist while he was out of town. I paid $2500 for it. 1998 with 117k miles on it, manual, and the top was recently replaced, so I figure that I'll get my fun value out of it, at least. It's the first car that I've had in ages that allows for amateur tinkering - lots of room to move around under the hood. The washer fluid pump was broken, and for about $16 (Rock Auto) and 5 minutes of effort, that was fixed. We've done a few other minor fixes as well, all pretty easy.

What kind of mileage you getting with the 2.7?
I have the 3.5 and just filled up, had 49 miles left according to the DTE reading.

Well, I don't buy premium, not recommended or needed according to Ford. On the road, I get around 21 to 22, depending on the speed and traffic. Around town, about 16 or 17, which is really good. My 2013 F150 with the 5.0L would get as high as 20.5 strictly highway, and around 14 in town. When I'm commuting here in downtown Houston, my average MPH (not MPG, MPH) is around 16.

I'm glad no one has asked me what kind of fuel economy I've been getting on my new car.  I bought the car on November 23rd with 11 miles on it.  I ""think"" I have 28-29 miles on it now - just not not sure.  It's supposed to get 20 mpg city, 30 mpg highway and 23 mpg combined.  One of these days I'll know for sure.

Not bad for a 330 hp V6 3.0 L twin turbo with 354 lb ft of torque.  Maybe on Sunday I can get to the car and get the feel of it from behind the wheel.

Hang in there, Mike, you will get the chance to drive your new car. This week I caught the 24 hour stomach bug, Wednesday morning about 1:30 a.m. I was lying on the bathroom floor in front of the toilet after heaving. My fever broke while I was asleep there on the vinyl floor, I woke up wringing wet, not sure where I was, how I got there, and why in the h-e-double-l I was soaking wet. A totally unpleasant experience, not near as bad as your present problems, but enough to make me truly appreciate the good health that I normally take for granted.

I was back at work on Thursday, and worked out at the gym today, fairly good recovery for an ""old man"". I will keep my fingers crossed for your speedy recovery as well.

Glad you're feeling better. I have been feeling lousy today but I think it is partly self-inflicted. I have to take pills for this hyperhidrosis I have had ever since the heart surgery. The pills are compounded at the local pharmacy, not premade. As a result they seem to vary in potency - sometimes not effective at all, sometimes very potent. A few times, like today, I get one that seems extra-powerful. The result is that I get a mouth as dry as cotton, some difficulty swallowing certain types of food, and a messed-up urinary system. It seems to be wearing off now so hopefully after tonight I will be back to normal. Not fun.

2 weeks ago my Dad went into the hospital for minor hernia surgery.  His doctor patched up the hernia on one side labroscopicaly, but the hernia on the other side required the doctor to cut him open the old fashioned way.  Once the doctor opened him up, he found scar tissue from a previous hernia wrapped around Dad's appendix.  So the appendix had to be removed.  When the doctor removed the appendix he nicked my Dad's colon.  Instead of an in & out ambulatory procedure, my Dad had to stay in the hospital for 3 days.  He was out if work for 2 weeks.

We have a very small family business that he is an integral part of.  To say that I was busy during the last 2 weeks is an underststen.  One of my employees came in on Monday not like himself.  I asked him how his weekend was & was everything OK.  He told me he woke up vomiting & also had the runs.  I stopped him right then & there & said:  ""stomach virus.  Go home.  Now.

Not minimizing the seriousness of it, but what Mike had was not surgery, but a procedure. May sound like semantics, but it is not done by a surgeon, rather an Interventional Cardiologist.
Not trying to be technical here but surgery is a procedure. And what Mike had was surgery as defined as a treatment in which a doctor cuts into someone's body in order to repair or remove damaged or diseased parts. Surgery can be as minor as removing a mole or extraction of a tooth and is not necessarily done by a surgeon.

1429,December 2015,graphicguy,"So, finally made it home late last night from a marathon set of business that took me from Cincinnati, to Orlando, to Denver in the span of 4 days.

Last car I rented in Denver was a Jeep Grand Cherokee. I'm noticing that the more I rent from Hertz, the more likely they are to put me in a ""step up"" model for the price of the company preferred ""compact"".

Anyway, pretty darned impressed with the JGC. I'll assume mine was a base model as it wasn't all leathered up and there were plenty of hard plastics all around. But, the V6 Pentastar motor moved it smartly and didn't sound like a John Deere knock off. Assuming the trans was Chrysler's 9 speed, it performed admirably. No hunting and searching, mostly shifting without me noticing it much. And, it kicked down a cog or two when I wanted it to.

Seats were comfortable, and again, I think they were the base seats. Suspension was solid, even though it was clear I was driving a relatively heavy vehicle. It did push through the corners, but not as badly as I expected.

The ride and handling is what I'd call giving a very solid feeling. No thumps, twists, skips, just solid feeling overall pavement types. Base ""uconnect"" was simple and easy to use, especially given I had never used such a system....EVER! Screen didn't have Nav and was small, but connecting my phone was easy. Speedo, tach etc were clear and easy to read, even with sunglasses. Might have even been a digital number. Good information shown between the speedo and tach....MPG, tire pressure, DTE, radio station, etc.

For the 3 days I had it, and 1/2 tank gas, I got 22 MPG in mixed driving, and I wasn't easy on it.

Pretty impressive. Last real SUV I had driven was my much loved Tahoe, but that was a decade old. If I were in the market for a luxury SUV and didn't need a huge one, I'd put the JGC as a ""must consider"" with the likely candidates from Lexus, Acura, etc.

Sure, if you already have a bike you regularly ride the best, least expensive way to go is to get a trainer that you affix to the rear wheel. These you can expect to pay a few hundred on up for a good one. You ca



However be aware that if you go this route it is best to get a special wheel to replace your rear wheel that is made for these trainers, it is a solid rubber tire and works better with the trainer.

If you want a indoor bike a good one should run you $500 or more. Stay away from recumbent ones unless you ride a recumbent bike. You would be best to get one with magnetic resistance and a solid flywheel in the rear and has a display that shows at least your wattage (shows how hard you work) and your cadence. I use a Kaiser which run $1,500 and up depending on the model.

In both cases for extra $$$ you can get a setup where you can plug in a route and have a computer use the resistance to simulate the terrain of your route.

Another way to go is getting a gym membership, they can be inexpensive and offer more than just bikes for exercise.

I would also suggest researching proper exercise techniques (tip: most spin instructors know squat about proper techniques). You can get a much better workout in 15 minutes with proper techniques than you can get in an hour with poor techniques.

1450,December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"Chrysler and GM did go into bankruptcy, chapter 11, restructure of debt. If you are suggesting that Chapter 7, which is liquidation, would have allowed GM or Chrysler to survive, all I can say is would you buy a car from a liquidated company? One doesn't see a new Pontiac or Oldsmobile driving around. And even if you did, how can a company continue after selling off most of its infrastructure? GM and Chrysler would have had to become something else, possibly a small branch of a Japanese or German company, making parts or some such.

Also we have to consider the loss of this infrastructure with regards to national security. Last of all, what president wants to preside over the destruction of the American automobile industry?

Given how well it turned out in the long run, the bailout is a stunning success--but as you say, not without its unpleasant aspects (like they say, if you want to understand politics, go visit a sausage factory).

After WW I Mercedes and Benz almost went bankrupt. High inflation and poor sales for German cars, along with increased competition almost put these two companies out of business.

The bank would give them a loan, but they would have to merge. Daimler and Benz never liked each other, but a merger was the only way to save the companies.

Without a merger and without a loan there wouldn't be a Mercedes Benz company, and I have no idea what I would be driving right now.
By some twist of history, later BMW was almost bankrupt and bought by Benz in 1959.

For me I have never been a huge Ford fan. There has always been something about them in terms of design or engineering that has failed to resonate with me. I don't hate them, I just don't find them appealing.

From the Ford products I've owned, my general perception was that they were screwed together better than the rest of D3, but they often didn't accommodate my six foot frame as well and the engines didn't seem all that strong, yet only got middling mileage. I've rented a few Ford products the past few years and seemed that for me, that was still the case (and the eco-boost turbo's seem a bit of a waste because they don't seem any better than a conventional V6 and there never seemed to be much fuel economy advantage in real world driving either).

I traded in a 2013 F150 with the 5.0L V8 engine for a 2015 F150 with the 2.7L V6 (twin turbo ecoboost). The 2.7L is faster than the 5.0L V8, and gets decidedly better gas mileage. Now as to the turbo 4 cylinders, I have no experience and no opinion. I can say that I owned a 2005 Mazda Tribute (same/same as Ford Escape), in which I fit comfortably. The new Escape, I don't fit at all. I have noticed a trend that cars seem to get smaller inside year after year, even while they get bigger outside.

Simply not true. Their loan was ""paid back"" at least partially by proceeds from an alternative energy government grant. They played a shell game with the billions to demonstrate how they ""paid back"" the government. Not to mention blatant violations of bankruptcy law forcing union fund payments before senior debt.

Hi!  Never got to the doctor - not enough strength.  I spoke with him on the phone.  He ordered a 1-hour home health nurse to check my vitals and report my condition to him two-three times a week.  He is also making an appointment with the cardiologist for next week sometime.

He said my liver enzymes were a little high, but that is to be expected with the medications I am taking.  All other test results were in the normal range.

My major problem at this point is weakness, faintness, etc., and getting short of breath upon exertion.  So it makes it difficult to prepare food.  A neighbor has been getting my mail each day and if I need something at Publix, he runs over for me.

Mike....I think I might get a 2nd opinion. Every heart procedure I've heard of (and cardio Dr, sister in law) recommends, rehab. I'm may be just a walk with a cane for 100 steps the first day. But, the want your heart rate to elevate, even a little, so it gets stronger and pushes blood through your repaired artery.

Rehab facility sounds reasonable. That way they can supervise your exercise routine. But, your surgeon should have sent you home with a list of things for you to do. Get to the cardio Doc he recommends as soon as possible.

In 1964, Volkswagen acquired Auto Union, and in 1969, NSU Motorenwerke AG (NSU). The former company owned the historic Audi brand, which had disappeared after the Second World War. VW ultimately merged Auto Union and NSU to create the modern Audi company, and would go on to develop it as its luxury vehicle marque. The purchase of Auto Union and NSU was a pivotal point in Volkswagen's history, as both companies yielded the technological expertise that proved necessary for VW to survive when demand for its air-cooled models went into decline

1497,December 2015,ab348,"Mike, I wonder if your insurance/benefits provider could offer some help in pointing you towards/setting up some of these things like transition or cardiac rehab programs? They are spending a bundle on you so it is in their best interests to get you well as soon as possible.

I can sympathize with where you're coming from. I have had a few medical misfortunes in my life but the one that reminds me of yours was about 25 years ago. I had been diagnosed with heart problems and went into the hospital for the cardiac cath procedure to see where the problems were. I was 33 at the time.

After it was done they wheeled me back into my room with the usual instructions not to move for a few hours, etc. I am laying in the bed and after a while I wasn't feeling right. I hit the call button and thankfully a nurse arrived quickly. I told her I wasn't feeling well and she peeled back the bedsheet and let out a yell before calling a code. At that point a bunch of interns and nurses rushed in and started going to work on me. I was bleeding internally into the leg where they had made the incision into the vein for the cath. As these people started trying to get a BP, put in an IV, etc., I felt myself slipping away. I remember a bunch of things, like someone saying my BP was 20/0, another person climbing on top of me to put pressure on the incision in my leg, and someone else saying they couldn't find a vein. I actually stopped breathing and had a near-death experience, which I could tell you about because it was wild, but which would take way too long. Fortunately the heart didn't stop and they were finally able to get enough plasma or whatever into me to bring the BP back up.

So all that happened and within a surprisingly short time I was feeling not too bad. I spent the night and they sent me home the next day. No instructions, no orders, nothing. I had lost a lot of blood and was feeling pretty wobbly. After a quiet night at home I went to bed. The next morning I woke up, stood up and immediately passed out, falling straight back onto the bed, thank god. I was out for a few minutes. That was a Saturday and needless to say I didn't have a very good weekend. My right leg was black and blue from the hip down to and including the foot thanks to all the blood that had emptied into it. On Monday I called my family doctor and got in to see him that afternoon. When I told him why I was there and what had happened he didn't believe me at first, until he had me drop my pants to see my leg. When he saw it, he exploded. He got on the phone and started chewing out people in the hospital about what had happened. After he ran out of people to yell at, he hung up the phone and told me I was *that* close to dying in there. I sort of knew that but he confirmed it and told me to not do anything for the next week, and what to watch out for.

The medical profession can work wonders, but is also amazingly bad at not managing cases very well sometimes.

Scary!  I think I got screwed because it was the Thanksgiving weekend.  I fell ill early Friday morning and got lucky there was a cardiologist at the hospital when I arrived.  I was in the cath lab in 25 minutes after arriving there.  They have a brand new cardiovascular unit at that hospital one floor above the ER.

As soon as I woke up, the pain was gone as was the shortness of breath.  I bled pretty badly in ICU where the catheter went in in my groin.  

I I will be speaking with my doctor tomorrow morning and see what he says.  Thanks for your support.

I have to agree with you that GM was singled out more vociferously for its sins.  But that might be due to better PR coming out of VW than came out of GM.

Couple of differences that make GM have more posts than VW.

* GM's mistake has directly led to deaths, and in accidents, nonetheless. VW probably has caused more dead through the extra pollution, but it's harder to quantify, and more importantly, harder to put ""a face"" to build a news cycle around

In this case there are no favorites. The story unfolded pretty accurately, both companies did a cover-up.

It is more than a few rogue engineers and a communication failure. You have to go through a whole process to order a new part and get all the codes changed. Management if not directly involved is involved for creating this need to cheat...and not admitting to it.....or not encouraging employees to report it.

My guess is they would have been reported the same in reverse. GM would be accused of beating pollution tests, VW for ignition failures. Just me, but, knowing people are dying because of a faulty part, and knowing about it for a decade, is much worse than cheating on pollution tests.

I have never worked for any car company. I have owned GMs and a few VW/Audi products, 4 in total. If I have a gripe it is with Audi because of the clutch problem......so I don't favor VW over GM...if anything the opposite. I still say not fixing a problem, when people are dying, is about as bad as it gets.

There was a news story yesterday that VW sales were down 25%. News is reported as it comes out. No need for daily updates.

IN SUMMARY: If I really liked a GM product today I would probably buy it....but, it would have to be superior in very many ways....because the trust is gone. The trust has gone from VW/Audi for me too. So, if I was in the market for a car I would only consider these makes if I found their cars to be the best by far in their category.

There is something that I really don't like in the world of business. It is when a company says, That was the old us, we don't do that any more. We have changed. That really says to me, we have changed because we got caught, now we start with a clean slate........well, for me, it ain't that easy.

1510,December 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"that was 2009, and it was a loan for 5.9 billion to help develop more fuel-efficient vehicles. Also, while Ford did not eventually take bailout money, it did actively lobby for the bailout previously, fearing that a collapse of the D2 would destroy many supply chains, and hence hurt Ford in a serious way. Ford also asked the government for a $9 billion line of credit for the future, should the situation in 2009 get worse (nobody knew at the time of course, how bad this would get). I don't know if Ford used that line of credit however.

Anyway, Ford's claim of not needing government assistance and of 'standing on its own' was disingenuous to say the least, no matter how one might regard the wisdom of the bailouts.

Perhaps I can claim hitting two targets with one stone? I had a 85 Renault Alliance convertible manufactured by AMC! It was a fun little car (to a degree). Certainly not very quick and was starting to have transmission issues around 40000 mi, It was a 5 speed and it would get stuck in 3rd gear when it rained. It was still under warranty so the dealer supposedly rebuilt part of the tranny. That did not address the issue. Traded it soon after for a new VW Fox.

IN SUMMARY: If I really liked a GM product today I would probably buy it....but, it would have to be superior in very many ways....because the trust is gone. The trust has gone from VW/Audi for me too. So, if I was in the market for a car I would only consider these makes if I found their cars to be the best by far in their category.
I have to agree. For decades the foreigncarphiles have excused not liking something from US brands that was equal by finding one detail that was not up to snuff, subjectively. Such as, the XX brand didn't have a cup holder in the middle of the dashboard like their favorite model YY has. And that was good enough to banish the competitive model. I suspect all the auto writers for the enthusiasts magazines who probably never drove a Malibu, Gen 7 or Gen 8, were condemning it as just more of what they didn't think was good 'nuf.

I doubt that most of the evaluations of the Malibu that panned Gen 7 and Gen 8 were by those who hadn't driven one other than a rental base model.

After WW I Mercedes and Benz almost went bankrupt. High inflation and poor sales for German cars, along with increased competition almost put these two companies out of business.

The bank would give them a loan, but they would have to merge. Daimler and Benz never liked each other, but a merger was the only way to save the companies.

Without a merger and without a loan there wouldn't be a Mercedes Benz company, and I have no idea what I would be driving right now.

Regarding VW transgression, I would disagree with Driver. GM's hand in deaths and coverups are dramatic and easy to demonstrate. However, a contribution from harmful emissions (40 times, people) to deaths and sickness of multiple individuals may actually be larger in aggregate, just much more difficult to show on a Jerry Bruckheimer-like computer simulation in a courtroom. This is especially true, if add all effects from millions of vehicles sold in Europe, not just US. If I had to find a parallel, I would go with tobacco and their efforts to increase addictive effects to increase sales.
I'm not so sure dino. I am thinking, even those emissions were higher than permitted, they are still probably a lot less than the emissions from most trucks.

There are some statistics that say so many 1000s will die from VWs emissions.......I just don't know if it can be proven, or is even true.

IMHO, the Daily Crisis has been invented by 24 hour news channels. If there is a disaster, CNN reports on it 24/7. I mean, I feel bad for the people caught up in those air disasters, and for the poor innocent people that were killed in Paris. But, how do you have reports every day for weeks about the same thing over and over....until the next disaster.

CNN's ratings go up when they have one disaster they can focus on, but do people really need that much negative news all day long?

Doubt it would be worth it for either of us to try to meet for what might only be an hour. Will be back soon. Next time I'll get give more notice and perhaps we can meet for dinner or lunch.

I know when I had my ""heart event"" I was in Chicago for Memorial Day weekend with my son. Drove to Chicago early on Friday. Walkes probably 5-6 miles in and around Michigan Ave. Went back to the hotel after a late dinner and started feeling a bit uneasy. Thought it was because I ate so late. Then, I started sweating. I hit the bed, my left arm and jaw started to ache and was pretty sure it was a heart attach.

Was bound and determined not to make a scene and freak my son out. Northwestern U Med Center was right across the street from our hotel. As calmly as I could, while trying not to show the pain I was in, I caught the hotel elevator, and walked (more like used a force of will to hobble across the street) to the lobby of Northwestern.

I must have looked pretty bad, because people got out of my way like the parting of the Red Sea. My son freaked anyway and ran to the receptionist and loudly told her it was an emergency and I needed a Dr. She informed him that the emergency room was around the block. He said, ""it's not for me....it's for him"", pointing at me. She looked at me sitting slumped in a chair and immediately called some sort of code over the intercom. Seconds later, here comes the stretcher, the nitro, the oxygen, and I was whooshed away.

Had two stents put in. The next day (Saturday), I sent my son home to Cincinnati, over his vehement protests. I didn't want to stay, but knew I had to.

Cardio Doc said once I was able to do 5 laps around the entire ICU floor. So, with IV and IV stand in tow, off I went. Starting at the Dr/Nurses' station so the could see me. Couldn't do it Saturday (but did two laps). Made a goal to double that on Sunday, and I succeeded. The 5 laps on Monday seemed a piece of cake after that and did 8 laps. Doc reneged on me for the release papers. Tuesday I did 10 laps, with the Doc watching and the nurses counting them down for me. I was gone by Tuesday afternoon. Was at work Wednesday, but only for a ½ day. But was back to full time the next week.

My rehab nurses and PT specialists pushed and prodded me and had me working out and feeling much better in short order.

Medical professionals don't get nearly enough credit for patching us up and putting us back on the right track. Eternally thankful for mine.

To be honest, in the last 5 or 6 years, it's been scary out there.  Today's mass shooting of at least 28 people (14 dead) in San Bernadino (I used to live 30 miles east of there in the low desert) has me a bit distressed.

It seems every week, something like this happens somewhere on a college campus or school or army/navy post.  When I walked the shopping mall, I would, at times, become a bit skiddish when I would pass by a group of older teenagers being a bit overly vocal.

I realize that chances are slim to none of my being involved in a mass shooting, but I avoid shopping malls and large public areas this time of year.

I have difficulty standing for more than 5 minutes.  I get dizzy and weak.  Some of this is attributable to some of the Hep C drugs.  Some due to being fairly inactive since Friday.

In the hospital, I was not ""walked""!  I was told Sunday late afternoon I was going home.  I had no caseworker, no PT, and the first time I was seen by the hospitalist was 5 minutes before discharge.  It took ICU almost a full day to find out who my admitting doctor was.

This hospital is awful - I had to go there because it was the closest one.  My father ended his life there for no reason.

So my care in the hospital was sub-par and I never knew who my doctor was.  I complained to my primary care physician about my care, and all he did was shake his head.

I think that might be something to consider. Usually a hospital social worker sets that up. Doesn't sound like you had one. Is there an agency you can call. It does not sound safe for you to be at home alone.

I've been waiting and watching to see how much interest the VW scandal is brought up compared to the GM scandal. The company knew about the lies in pollution and mileage claims a year ago. When GM's early knowledge of a problem with the switches was exposed, there were many posts about that topic. With VW, it's been almost crickets here since this was in the news a few days back. LOL

""In early November, two months after more than 11 million Volkswagen vehicles were found to be using software that deliberately underreported nitrous oxide emissions, the German car maker said that it had discovered that another 800,000 of its cars understated their carbon dioxide output and fuel efficiency. Volkswagen maintained that it only found out about the discrepancy in the wake of the wider diesel emissions scandal, but German newspaper Bild am Sonntag this weekend countered that assertion, reporting that Volkswagen executives knew about the false claims a full year ago.""

I read this morning that Honda sales also dipped a bit - 1-2%.

VW has been providing ""floor plan"" monetary incentives to assist dealers with the financial burden they have been faced with since this diesel debacle.  Additionally, VW has provided additional money to assist with dealer operations.

The major fall-out will be felt by small dealers which cannot survive 25% drops in sales.  I wonder if dealerships who are forced out of business will have legal claims against the manufacturer for causing their investments to dematerialize?  Going to be an interesting chain of events over the next several years if VW can survive without being nationalized by the German Government.  I've heard rumors of that scenario as a last resort option.

1571,December 2015,dino001,"I agree. The VW reporting is exhaustive and frequent, with calls for a punishment and predictions of long lasting legal troubles. The US government fines alone are potentially up to $18B, or actually more now, as even more engines have been reported. We will see of course how much it will really be when it comes - knowing green agenda of this administration, I think it's going to be substantial. Also, European authorities are now taking VW into the task, including overinflated gas mileage numbers on some of their models. I do think their action will be weaker, as they have too much at stake in terms of job losses and I'm quite convinced VW was not the only one cheating on their tests, as it is clear that EU regulations were both unrealistic and full of loopholes. In fact, I think VW is waiting for news from others and they will probably get some, or they'll strike a secret deal with EU to not disclose others in exchange for more lenient treatment there.

I only wonder what else is there to say or do against VW that would satisfy the expressed sense of unbalanced injustice and reporting against GM. Full government-manadated shutdown? Public executions of the executives? Rallies in front of VW stores with violence against salesmen and property damage? Would that be enough to balance the alleged GM's harm?

Audi sales YTD through November up 11.7% to 181,803 vehicles
Sales for the month rose 0.4% to 16,700 vehicles
Demand for core Audi models remained strong for the month



Audi reported that its November 2015 sales increased 0.4% to 16,700 vehicles, a total that stands as the brand’s 59th straight month of record U.S. sales.

Audi achieved its best-ever November sales in the U.S. in establishing its 59th consecutive monthly sales record. The previous November record was set in 2014 with 16,640 Audi vehicles sold. Through the first 11 months of 2015, Audi U.S. sales rose 11.7% from last year to 181,803 vehicles, which is only 208 units short of what Audi sold in an entire year in 2014.

“As we head into the final sales month, we are on track to achieve our sixth-consecutive record year and exceed 200,000 annual sales for the first time,” said Mark Del Rosso, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Audi of America. “We expect this strong momentum will continue into 2016 as we refresh some of our most popular models, such as the Audi Q7, A4 and R8.”

November results were bolstered by sales of core Audi models, such as the A3, A5 and A7. These three model lines posted increases of 20.6%, 20.2% and 8.2%, respectively. The Audi SUV models also performed well. The Q3 model achieved a 50.9% increase over year-earlier sales, and the Q5 model line posted an increase of 8.0% over last November.

Regarding VW transgression, I would disagree with Driver. GM's hand in deaths and coverups are dramatic and easy to demonstrate. However, a contribution from harmful emissions (40 times, people) to deaths and sickness of multiple individuals may actually be larger in aggregate, just much more difficult to show on a Jerry Bruckheimer-like computer simulation in a courtroom. This is especially true, if add all effects from millions of vehicles sold in Europe, not just US. If I had to find a parallel, I would go with tobacco and their efforts to increase addictive effects to increase sales.

Neither VW or GM should be proud of what they did, but the transgressions aren't at the same level. Takata air bags are a lot closer to the GM situation, as lives were lost directly as a result of the cover-up.

The deaths in the GM cases were in most instances people who were drunk, drugged up, driving recklessly or a combination of all 3, running into something at high speed. We will never know if they would have died or not if the ignition was still on, but GM took the blame. I have seen no evidence that it was a corporate decision but rather that of an engineer or he and those he worked closely with. We do know that VW deliberately did what they did to bypass the regulations and defraud both their customers and the government.

I would agree that Takata is closer to the GM situation. Of the 3 transgressions, we hear the least about that. Where is the equivalent outrage?

When I first got home after my surgery it took me a few days to be able to do much. I started with walking from the living room to the bathroom or kitchen. Then I started to walk laps around the main level of the house. It takes time. You've been through a lot.

A business associate told me that he had a double or triple bypass done in secret! He left work on what he told them was a 3 week vacation, had the scheduled surgery the next day, and went back to work after the 3 weeks was up. I found it impossible to believe but some people are crazy I guess.

I would never say ""never"". You have no idea if other cars would be as good, or even if they are any more honest.

It isn't likely I would buy another Audi product, but, if they made the best vehicle by far in the category I was looking for, if the price was right, if I was sure this model passed the tests, if the car felt better than the competition.......I would probably risk it. There just isn't enough choices to never buy a particular brand ever again.

But, two years from now will they even put it together? People don't equate GM to faulty ignitions, Ford to Pintos that caught on fire, Audi to a faulty brake pedal, BP to an oil spill, Exxon to the same, or tainted foods such as cheese, ice cream, hamburgers etc.

Taos is a great little place, delightful really, but it gets ""small"" mighty fast. And it gets COLD man, mighty cold. I was pretty jumpy after a 3 month housesit there. (Keep in mind I was born in Manhattan) . I think I was warmer when I worked in Alaska--probably because the house wasn't made out of mud.

I think once you get older, this type of lifestyle is more difficult. I lived on boats (and houseboats) for many years, and some of those off the grid. Had 12 V electrics, solar recharge, wood heat (dangerous on a boat), diesel stove backup, propane fridge and stovetop. Nice little boat, 32 footer, beamy, good headroom. I even anchored offshore for about 8 months, and had a little runabout to get me to and fro. It was very dreamy and romantic, but not easy livin'. I wouldn't even think of doing that at this stage in life, but I'm sure glad I did way back then. The real ""houseboats"" are more luxurious, and that's not a bad way to live at all--but it's hardly an alternative lifestyle anymore. Now you have to pony up big bucks for a houseboat, and you don't even own the land underneath it. (more like how a mobile home park works). Some houseboats are as well equipped as any modern home.

Oh, there's a tower somewhere along the highway their antenna can hit. Wireless internet. Pretty good signal.

I had the same setup in Boise - I lived up a hill in a ""strategic"" location and got free wireless internet for years by having a repeater gizmo on my roof for the ISP. My access was through a small box on the roof, not even a dish. That was an option here in Las Cruces since we barely get DSL out in my part of the county.

Other than brushing off the snow on the panels and checking the cisterns occasionally, it's a pretty low maintenance place up in Taos. I change more filters, use a lot more propane and deal with the same bumpy gravel road as they do. They check their batteries quarterly and top 'em up if need be. They drive a Subaru in the winter and don't plow their long driveway.

Our friends' issue is that it's a 40 minute drive to town. That gets old. Shoot, I'm 15 minutes from a store here and that bugs me. I think I could live in Taos proper since I could walk and bike everywhere, but the tourists would wear on me. The locals know the shortcuts but the main drag is bumper to bumper in high season. It's too small for my wife though.

Well, I can go home, but I do not have 3 or 4 of the new meds they prescribed at home and the hospital does not dispense take-home drugs.  Walgreens is not open here at the hospital this weekend (they fill prescriptions for patients and I buy all my meds at Walgreens).  So if they dischsrge me now, I would need to take a cab home, get dressed, and then drive to the Walgreens I use by the house.  I really do not have the strength to do that and I don't have anyone who can help me who is in town.

So I guess they are figuring out what to do for me.  You would think they would try to make things easier for someone who is recovering from a heart attack.  I hate this hospital - this is the place where my Dad was in June - I don't trust anyone here.

Mike, I of course have no idea what your lifestyle was like other than what I saw you post here. Speaking for myself, based on my own experience, it is important not to obsess over this stuff regarding your heart. It can rapidly lead to even more stress, self-induced, or become like a new job.

I know in my case I never fully recovered from the side effects of my surgeries. Complications made me lose about 40% of my lung capacity, which makes walking any distance or exerting myself difficult, even with the heart functioning well. The valve replacement led to a racing heartbeat (I am told), which requires drugs, which have other side effects. Then something - nobody has satisfactorily explained exactly what - led to hyperhydrosis, or excessive sweating, which is partly controlled by still more drugs though not well. Given those 3 conditions I am not about to run any marathons. It's funny - before the surgery I had chest pain and really couldn't do much physically. Now after the surgery I don't have the chest pain but still can't do very much, for different reasons. Not what I expected, which was to feel like I did before all this stuff started to occur. But that was when I was in my 30s and now I am almost 60 so I can't realistically expect to feel the same way.

Everyone is different and has different capacities and abilities. Do what you can, but don't push it. A guy I worked with had a similar incident to yours, received stents, and was in and out several times when they caused problems or collapsed. His was all due to stress, first over not getting back to work right away, then later from being stressed about work! Unreal. I think he is on happy pills now as he seems different in terms of personality.

I feel a bit helpless.  I have no one I can lean on for help - physical or emotional.

Very weak and I get dizzy when I stand so I can remain upright for only a short time.  I have to drink lots of fluids to keep from becoming dehydrated. 

I'll have to call out got something for dinner as I am in no condition to cook anything.  My insurance company is sending me a 10 day supply of frozen meals (hope I can fit everything in my freezer).

How did they get my email address? No one has that, not even my employer. I didn't give it to anyone involved. What data base could put that information together to identify it to an insurance company?

Kind of scarey.

Google water rates going up in L.A.

This story is referring to San Diego where water rates are increasing by 25%:

So what’s driving the soaring rates? This is awkward but … you’re part of the problem. You and a bunch of other factors. Let’s run through them.
You can blame yourself for saving too much water.

The price hikes are driven – ironically enough – by the cutbacks San Diegans are making because of the drought. If the city is selling less water, then the city has to charge more for each drop it sells.

The Leaf would cost me $3.60 to charge, so 3.6 cents per mile

Since we, the consumers, are willing to pay about 6 cents per mile for fuel to travel, why would we NOT expect the cost of a replacement fuel to start to approach that number?

Thanks, berri.  I just got home from hospital after picking up Rx's.  Very tired and weak.  I will try to get in to see my primary care physician tomorrow morning if I feel I can drive safely.

The last three EKG's they did in hospital were all normal - no sign of muscle damage.  I initially thought that when a coronary artery fully occludes, it causes muscle to die.  But cardiologist said I had enough peripheral blood supply at the affected area that the muscle survived.  Now that the stent is in place, it is supplying blood at normal levels.  Like the doctor said, I called 911 in time and the emergency catheterization and stent placement made my future prognosis positive.

I have tons of new medications - so I need to consult with my primary care physician and go over the 18-20 pills I have to take which include the 10 hep C anti-virals.

The single most important factor in any new car purchase is the buyer's credit score. A good credit score can result in a new car financed for sixty months for a relatively minor total interest cost. For example, a new Civic with good credit could be financed for 60 months with around $400 in total interest, if financed at .9 percent.

On the flip side, a person with a bad credit score would pay an Audi payment, with good credit, for a Honda Civic."

I would disagree with your first sentence of your post.  Interest rate and term have to be considered as part of the cost of buying a specific vehicle.

Let me explain why:

Assume both buyers in the scenario below are 38 year old males with the exact same FICO score of 792 and have the exact same annual incomes.

Buyer #1 purchases a Honda Accord at dealer A for $25,000 out the door.  He is financed for $15,000 through the dealer for 60 months at an interest rate of 1.75% annually.

Buyer #2 purchases the same exact Honda Accord at dealer B for the exact same $25,000 out the door.  He is financed for 60 months at an annual interest rate of 2.1%.

Buyer #1 paid less for his car that buyer #2 paid for his car because he is paying more out of pocket due to a higher interest rate.

Dealers make a kick-back of 1% or more from the bank providing the financing or even the manufacturer's financial arm like Honda Financial.  I know first-hand of many deals that went through finance where the kick-back to the dealer was as much as 3% of loan value.

I agree that Fico scores are a major determinant of the cost of borrowing money, but dealers can still make back-end profit on financing or leasing - it depends on how knowledgable the buyer is on existing rates for his FICO score.  Dealers try to make profit any way they can.  The higher back-end profit, the higher the net cost to the buyer.

Stever and Snake, very good analysis and I would tend to agree.

2 things though, I think it could happen that the more expensive car could end up costing less in the long run even if it didn't in this case,

and,

somehow, my brother traded in his 10 year old Honda Civic in 2012, and bought a brand new Hyundai Elantra and paid just $4000 difference - so that must mean something.

Snake, your book is pretty good. I read the free part and it is very well done. Good luck, just remember the little people if you make it big.

Yes it can happen that a more expensive care would actually cost less after all things considered. There are many variables that would determine these things.

Dealers try to make profit any way they can.  The higher back-end profit, the higher the net cost to the buyer.
  I know it happened to me when I bought my BMW for European Delivery. I was essentially at their mercy, as the rules required full payment to BMW a few weeks before Munich delivery, which is more than two months before the car would clear the Customs. No bank would do that for an individual (no title, no loan), so I had to swallow the rate, whatever it was. 3.8% wasn't so bad at the time, but still well above market for my score. The moment the car hit shores, I refinanced with the same bank at 2.6% plus small closing fees. Saved me about $1000 over the course of the loan. The experience was worth it though.

Is it true that the dealers don't get full loan commission until 6 months pass? If so, this could be a leverage in those situations. If I'm positive I can qualify for a better rate, I could tell the guy next time not to get too greedy, as he won't see the whole thing anyway. If the rate differential is small, the stamps and fees eat the difference, so it's not worth it, but if it gets too high, so he could get some markup, but not too much.

I was trying to find out how many people buy a car based on the monthly payment. I believe it is pretty high.
I believe it is very high especially considering that the average car costs 50% or more than the average yearly household income. Face it, the average household would find it difficult to save enough money to pay cash for a reliable car. Also it is wise to look at what the monthly payment would be so you know that you can afford it.

Also negotiating the monthly payment isn't bad as long as you know what you are doing and don't fall into any traps. Basically your monthly payment is basically based on 4 things; 1) total out the door price, 2) the down payment. 3.) the interest rate and 4.) the term of the loan. Now you can play around with any of those 4 to get the price down, but if you are firm on what your down payment will be and how long you want the loan to be then all they can do is lower the price or reduce the interest to get the monthly payment down.

If I do this I know what I want to pay (both in a monthly payment and the down payment) and I know what financing I have (or can get) from the bank. From that I can work it backwards to figure out what the price of the car would be. Making a bigger down payment or extending the loan is me giving in to get the payment I want and I would stand firm on that, make them come down in price to reduce the payment.

1648,November 2015,sb55,"I'll add to the washing machine discussion.
We own a summer cottage rental business (www.treetopsvt.com) so have a lot of laundry at least once a week on changeover day. Most guests bring their own sheets unless we rent them, but we still have bedspreads and blankets. We have 3 machines in total. 2 regular agitator types in the seasonal laundry room and 1 top load high efficiency one in our house. We had a 10 year old Maytag that finally bit the dust. We decided to get the largest one at a reasonable cost, so bought a big Whirlpool 5.3 cubic foot one this summer. What a POS. We had the repair guy here more than once in the 1st month. If you tried to wash 1 bedspread, it would get off balance, drain itself, refill, then try again....and again... and again. You could not redistribute the load and start from where it was. It always refilled and started up from scratch. There was no ""spin only"" cycle. It could take 4 hours and we'd still end up with a sopping wet 40 lb bedspread that we could spin in the old machines. 2 bedspreads or larger load seemed to work sometimes.
We were lucky that we bought it a Lowes. They were great and suggested that we swap it for a 4.9 cubic foot LG. (.4 cubic foot difference is about a 1"" shorter tub) So far, it's been great and seems to work as it should.
Now that winter is here our cleaning season is over. Hooray for that!

And this was kind of interesting:
Sometimes less-expensive cars can actually cost more over time than a car with a higher sticker price.

Compare, for instance, the Honda Civic LX four-door sedan, priced at $16,155, and the Hyundai Elantra GLS, which costs $14,101. Say you're making a 15 percent down payment and taking out a 60-month loan at 5.76 percent. According to automotive data provider Intellichoice, the Honda will cost $3,116 less to own after a five-year period than the Hyundai because it doesn't depreciate as quickly, and its insurance, fuel and maintenance costs are less.
I am going to call BS on this one. Presuming that the prices include all taxes, licenses and doc fees you would be putting down $2,417 on the Honda and 2,115 on the Hyundai, you would be paying $263.29 and 230.38 respectively as monthly payments. giving a total of all payments $18,214.65 and $15,938.24 respectively meaning that the Hyundai would be $2,276.41 less in payments.

As for fuel costs the average driver drives 15K miles a year, the EPA figures are 35 MPG for the Honda and 28 for the Hyundai at $2.75 a gallon that would give a total fuel cost at $5,892.86 and $7,366.07 receptively. making the Honda $1,473 cheaper to run, so these two together makes the Hyundai a little more than $800 less expensive (even more so with today's lower gas prices.)

Now lets face it, maintence costs in the first 75,000 miles are not going to be much different between the two cars. It's not like either one is going to need much, if any, work done other than routine maintenance.

So that leaves depreciation and insurance for the Honda being nearly $4,000? I find that a little hard to believe seeing that it is almost 25% of the price of the car.

one problem with doing a LT cost analysis is that a lot of people can't handle the monthly nut. not to mention they don't think about resale down the line!

you could probably make a case that it is ""free"" to own a few cars (the right Ferrari maybe?) if it didn't depreciate, except you would have to be able to handle the $3,000/month payments!
The tricky thing is that resale numbers down the line can be tricky, a few years ago could you have predicted the current resale value for a VW diesel?

Secondly the longer you own a car the less resale value is an issue, after say 200K miles there isn't much difference in the resale value of comparable cars.

Stever and Snake, very good analysis and I would tend to agree.

2 things though, I think it could happen that the more expensive car could end up costing less in the long run even if it didn't in this case,

and,

somehow, my brother traded in his 10 year old Honda Civic in 2012, and bought a brand new Hyundai Elantra and paid just $4000 difference - so that must mean something.

though she did already get the 2 $500 cards. So hopefully it all works out in the end. Though I expect they are planning to keep it a real long time, so resale won't be an issue!

maybe should have just gotten a Prius. The SIL has one, and they brought it when they came up (from DC to Philly). BIL said the car reported they got 58 MPG on the trip (no traffic issues, and he does not drive fast).

Here in Nova Scotia the previous ""progressive"" (left-wing) government had an ambitious program to generate 40% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2020. To do that they encouraged people to build windmills, do home solar, etc and established a rate for selling that back to the power monopoly that was a lot higher than what the utility would spend if it was generating power itself. Rates charged on a power bill, of course, went up. They ended up getting more of those little renewable sources built than they needed, so the new government here discontinued the program. But power rates are unlikely to ever go down much here. The majority of or power comes from coal and oil, and even with the decline in oil prices, it will only result in something like a 3% reduction this coming year.

1673,November 2015,abacomike,"  Additionally, prices paid for automobiles in auto malls of 5-10 dealership brands were more flexible in their pricing than those in stand-alone locations.  Of course, I found the usual exceptions to this set of hypotheses, but in general, the two mentioned above definitely impacted the final prices paid for new automobiles and trucks and SUV's.

Let me explain.  Dealerships located in the middle to low range socio-economic areas tended to make higher ""back-end"" profits in financing and insurance and maintenance warranties than those located in upper middle and high end socio-economic areas.  Those same dealerships made less front-end profits (actual selling price of vehicle).  One must remember that back-end profits can actually outperform front end profits due to lower spreads of invoice to MSRP percentages.  In higher socio-economic areas, front end profits are much higher than back-end profits. Less profit in financing due to consumers with 750+ credit scores.

As for large auto malls, many shoppers have an opportunity to shop for their new cars sort of like one-stop shopping.  Competition between and among the brands is fierce in these malls.  An example would be Chevy, Ford, Dodge-Chrysler, Toyota, Hyundai, Cadillac, Lincoln, Infinii, Lexus, BMW and Mercedes.  In LA, there are many malls like that as there are in Jersey, Long Island and other suburban areas throughout the country.  Better pricing is usually found on vehicles purchased in a mall locale like I mentioned above.

The above data became available to me through the conglamorate that owned the dealership I managed.  We would receive monthly printouts of each dealer's breakdown of profits from Finance/Insurance, Vehicle sales profits, Service and Parts.  Those dealerships in auto malls tended to sell more units, but at lower profit margins.  Those dealerships in higher sociology-economic areas had higher profit margins in the sale end and lower profit margins in the back-end.  The reverse was true in lower socio-economic areas.

This information can be very helpful to new car buyers:

If you want better pricing on a new vehicle and you have high credit scores, where might you concentrate your dealership search?

If you have marginal credit, where would you concentrate your dealership search?

Remember, there are exceptions to the above (repeat customers get preferential pricing front and back-end no matter where they buy their cars).

Try it out the next time you are pricing a new car.  You might be surprised.

Self published E Books have opened the door to make it possible for anyone to ""publish"" a book, at least electronic book. Just before that there was vanity publishing. You would pay a company a few $1000s to print a book for you, and they would do minimal marketing.

To make a book take off you would have to sell it somehow, get it into a chain store, or a number of bookstores to show a record of sales, or try to get some publicity on radio, TV or in the newspaper.

A few E-books have actually caught on and have become million sellers, and the author has been picked up by a major publishing house.

Yes, firefighter, when the data is carefully dissected and applied properly to a set of hypotheses, it begins to make sense in terms of selecting a set of strategies one can use in buying their next new car.

I had access to data reporting sales at 72 dealerships owned by this one corporation.  Almost without exception, location of the dealership and the sociology-economic status of the average consumer the dealership sold cars to was a good predictor of the pricing of new cars.  Those dealerships in the upper socio-economic areas would be be where a person might shop for better financing rate flexibility since those dealerships had lower profitability in the back-end.

In other words, once a buyer determines which is most important to them when buying a new car (financing, front-end pricing of the vehicle or competitive shopping easier such as an auto mall), a strategy could be developed as to where to shop.

If the owner does fairly large loads that fill with water higher and uses bleach in those loads or uses the oxygen boosters, sodium carbonate and sodium percarbonate by SUN at Walmart, e.g., the inside of the tub is kept nice and clean. If small loads, like most of mine, are done, then a cleaning once a month with a cup of bleach or a large dose of the oxygen cleaner works.

The Afresh tablets are the Na Percarbonate/carbonate cleaners with some detergent and scent mixed in. Oxyclean is a name brand for the oxygen cleaner, but I use the SUN brand at 1/5 the cost or less. Is throw in a squirt of Dawn detergent when cleaning cycle starts with the bleach and turn off the cycle at about 1/2 hour when it empties the tub: I skip the rinse. Just let 'er dry.

The cleaning cycle is lots of agitation while filling to the top of the tub to rinse the soap residue from the stainless tub and the plastic tub in which it sits. Then a drain and refill to rinse.

A little history on the Neptune front loaders..., users who used the bleach or oxygen cleaners had few problems with the mold build up on the door seals. A friend of ours had bought one early on. They got rid of it if I recall. I don't know if they bought another front loader or a top loader.

It makes perfect sense, Mike. One could add there are also general differences between low end and uoscale brands, as well. I have owned two Subarus and a BMW in last twelve years and the purchasing experiences were generally positive, but not necessarily lowest price, always treating me like a partner in business. Then an occasional visit at a popular brand store (most those are parts of large multibrand chains) and I feel like I need a long hot shower. Doesn't matter whether it's Kia, Ford, or Toyota. Just awful. The worst part, they never listen, constantly ask idiotic questions, trying to frame it into ""how much per month"", even when I tell them that's my last concern. Couple of times I let them to show me first number, just for the hell of it and it always ended with a disaster. No price, some stupid number per month, when asked what is the interest, ""I don't know"", etc. They have absolutely no idea how to deal with an informed customer with decent means. It all end with me leaving shaking my head about American public. Those underhanded ""strategies"" and ""per month"" approach must obviously work, given how common they are, to the point they often are unable to change it even if it hits them in the face.

Before the net, I borrowed a friend's Bottom Line Personal all the time for such insider tidbits. Stuff like this, which wasn't so easy to find when it wasn't piped into your house 24/7.

I met a ""good"" salesguy in the 70s who sold cars in Houston. The dealership was situated where you could see cars coming a mile away. He'd hang around out front around 5 pm and paid attention to who was driving up to pick up their car from service. He'd checked the service files that morning to see who was in for an oil change or whatever.

When he'd recognize a customer of his driving toward the dealer, he'd pop out his hanky and start polishing a spot on the hood of the customer's car that he had conveniently driven to the front of the store.

Guy claimed he was swamped in repeat business.

Definitely agree.

The dealer in the fancy shmancy area knows people don't want to drive a few more miles to save a few $1000s. Also, a lot of these cars are driven by their wives, and heaven forbid their wife may have to drive for an extra 20 minutes for service. The fancy area dealer knows this. They know they will make more profit with this business plan.

Our former Audi dealer tried to get full MSRP for the A4 once. When I told him bmw was giving me 4% off they matched it immediately. He explained, we are in an area with mostly business people, they are pretty sophisticated buyers, so we don't fool around with them. bmw could get full msrp, Audi knew they couldn't.

I did find out you should only spend 8% of your income to finance a car. I also read that 36 months is probably the best length of time to keep from going upside down on your depreciating vehicle. Some loans are for 60, 72 or 84 month now.

And this was kind of interesting:
Sometimes less-expensive cars can actually cost more over time than a car with a higher sticker price.

Compare, for instance, the Honda Civic LX four-door sedan, priced at $16,155, and the Hyundai Elantra GLS, which costs $14,101. Say you're making a 15 percent down payment and taking out a 60-month loan at 5.76 percent. According to automotive data provider Intellichoice, the Honda will cost $3,116 less to own after a five-year period than the Hyundai because it doesn't depreciate as quickly, and its insurance, fuel and maintenance costs are less.

Self published E Books have opened the door to make it possible for anyone to ""publish"" a book, at least electronic book. Just before that there was vanity publishing. You would pay a company a few $1000s to print a book for you, and they would do minimal marketing.

To make a book take off you would have to sell it somehow, get it into a chain store, or a number of bookstores to show a record of sales, or try to get some publicity on radio, TV or in the newspaper.

A few E-books have actually caught on and have become million sellers, and the author has been picked up by a major publishing house.

Becoming an author who can live off their publishing has about the same odds as becoming a famous pop singer. Not great but if you have an idea or an idea for book you might as well go for it....you never know.
That was my thought about it, it might not go far but at least you can't say I didn't try. A few people have bought the book so at least I have that going for me.

These days it is easy to get it to market as an e-book, there are sites that will do it for you for a small commission of the sales. So my book is listed on most e-book sellers like Barnes and Noble with no upfront costs to me. The difficult thing is to get people to buy the darn thing.

Earlier this week our clothes drier went kaput....again. We've owned the current set of washer and drier for 8 years and in at time the washer broke down twice and now the drier twice. We traced the fault to a control board failure, which was the previous problem, so that equates to three board failures on the same drier. Crazy. An extended warranty covered the first failures but not this time.

The first decision was whether to fix or replace. The board is about $200 and would need to be ordered in with a week lead time. That decision took about 1/1000 of a second. No way I was investing more money into those unreliable units. No way.

Next decision was the replacement set. Normally I'm a research freak and would take days to investigate options. With Thanksgiving upon us and a crazy work schedule, I went about this an entirely weird way. The wife and I stopped by a Home Depot while our daughter was in swim practice and simply picked a set we both liked within 30 minutes of arriving. Totally not our style. And strangely liberating.

The only criteria we set were that they had to be made in the USA, be of a certain size or larger, and be efficient. We wound up with the Maytag Maxima, which were on a decent sale.
We have a Maytag set that we have had for, probably, 27 years. It still looks good and still works fine. Only problem was one time the washer wouldn't fully empty the water after it was done. I called a repair guy and a sock had somehow got behind the drum. He removed the sock and it has continued to work fine.

I have wanted to replace them a few times, but my wife says they work OK, why replace them? I can't argue with that logic.

The old 1970s-'80s Maytags were indeed built like tanks. The Maytag repairman schtick had some basis in reality. Then new management came in and screwed the company up royally. Acquisitions, debt, cost-cutting, the usual blunders. The Neptune washer line nearly bankrupted them because of all the problems. They were bought by Whirlpool in '06 and they became an entry-level brand. For a time after the purchase they were very troublesome machines. Whirlpool did some unsavory things to the former Maytag employees pensions and benefits. I don't know if todays Maytag products are cheapo Whirlpool machines or if they have their own designs. Not sure what their reputation is like these days.

About 5 years ago my old 1980s Whirlpool washer and dryer gave up the ghost. I ended up choosing a LG front load pair. Very happy so far.

Back in the ""days"", GE and Frigidaire made the best refrigerators; Maytag and GE and Hopoint made the best electric ranges; Maytag and GE made the best washers and dryers; and GE and KitchenAide made the best dishwashers.

When my parents bought the Condo in 1991, the builder provided all GE appliances.  After 25 years, I just replaced the refrigerator (Whirpool) but the dishwasher, oven/range and washer/dryer are still functioning quite well.

I think I am going to have to replace the washer/dryer (dryer on top of washer in my laundry closet) in the near future.  But I pay $325 a year to a large maintenance company that repairs all my appliances at no charge as well as lighting and plumbing.  

I will probably go with GE again because of how reasonably priced they are and are one of the few manufacturers that build stacked mini-washers and dryers that will fit in my laundry closet.  Just my opinion, of course, from positive experiences.

Not only is the access screw frozen, you have to have a pump centering tool to reinstall it assuming you can break it loose and a new gasket is required. So $40 just to clean it. Pass.

Our friend with the LG French Door frig (the one whose light fixture melted and almost burned her house down, fixed under a recall) has a funky ice maker. It's mostly working but the solenoid that opens the ice chute is bad or hopefully just corroded. Will try to fix that without breaking the bezel. Terrible frig, lousy reviews.

For most of the 90s we had a front loader before they were ""popular"" and before drought issues were a concern. It worked great. The new toploaders don't have agitators which appeals to me, although we haven't had any torn clothes with the washer that came with this house.

The wet circuit board issue reminds me of the poorly placed cupholders in the older Audi A8s. One little spill of your lemonade and your MMI board would get fried. $$$$.

I guess if I had qualms about meeting a stranger I would set the inspection up in the police station parking lot or let the seller know that I wouldn't be carrying any money until we had a deal. Then we could complete the deal at a bank or other safe spot.

Thanks, verdugo.  Luckily they have WiFi for the patients and guests.

It's eerie here in ICU - I have the same nurse who cared for my Dad his last day or two here.  I even have his same room.  Sounds a bit ironic.  

They just recently did another EKG and the results were shocking - no evidence of my having a heart attack.  How can that be?  I had several EKG's done this morning and they clearly showed evidence  that I was having a heart attack.  The cardiologist said even though I experienced a heart attack, it was the emergency catheterization and stent done within 40 minutes of my arrival at the ER that saved my heart.

1759,November 2015,tyguy,"Earlier this week our clothes drier went kaput....again. We've owned the current set of washer and drier for 8 years and in at time the washer broke down twice and now the drier twice. We traced the fault to a control board failure, which was the previous problem, so that equates to three board failures on the same drier. Crazy. An extended warranty covered the first failures but not this time.

The first decision was whether to fix or replace. The board is about $200 and would need to be ordered in with a week lead time. That decision took about 1/1000 of a second. No way I was investing more money into those unreliable units. No way.

Next decision was the replacement set. Normally I'm a research freak and would take days to investigate options. With Thanksgiving upon us and a crazy work schedule, I went about this an entirely weird way. The wife and I stopped by a Home Depot while our daughter was in swim practice and simply picked a set we both liked within 30 minutes of arriving. Totally not our style. And strangely liberating.

The only criteria we set were that they had to be made in the USA, be of a certain size or larger, and be efficient. We wound up with the Maytag Maxima, which were on a decent sale.

Many of the washers and dryers are really built well these days. My wife can make a decision on things like that in about 2 minutes....if it has the features she wants and a good brand name she will just buy it. Me, I come from a family who have to take time to decide, do research, check other brands, then ponder for hours or days. Her method is much better for mental well being.......and usually works out fine.

At least yours konked out around Black Friday....there were excellent sales on appliances.

It's only a guess but I nyou made the right decision to buy new and not fix. 8 years, you pretty well got your use out of the old one (way less than $100 a year to dry your clothes), and if the drier broke down again you would be out almost the price of a new one.

We bought our current washer dried about 8 years ago. Whirlpool Cabrio -- electronic controls. No problem. The guy at the repair parts store had warned me about electronic controls in appliances giving lots of trouble: he know because he sees how many go over the counter to retail customers as well as the repair guys, who mostly pick up their parts at the 3 locations around the area. I bought the 5 year add on warranty. First time I had done that. Never had to use it. Made in USA

We bought a washer/drier for son when he moved into his apartment. Picked ones without electronic controls. Maytag. Sale price. Glass top on washer like our Cabrio model. So you can watch the suds. Made in USA

Friends who moved to South Carolina dumped their LG or Samsung fridge because of trouble getting repair and parts. Local guy is service authorized, but he has trouble getting parts. Problematic.

It wasn't my goal to offend anyone over my grill comment. I should have said ""In my not so humble opinion that grill is ugly""

Iur next door neighbor just bought a new Lexus SUV and it's got that grill and although I still don't care for it, I have gotten used to it a bit. In any event it seems this has become the latest style."

You should be fine - actually better than you were before. If you weren't on them already they will want to put you on statins when you get out. Be careful about that. They work miracles on cholesterol, but the side effects can be sneaky.

The other good thing about avoiding the surgery is that you wouldn't be able to drive your nice new Benz for 6 weeks.

My ATS has one of those front and rear. It is a threaded female socket for a towing hook. The actual hook, a big, heavy cast metal thing, is stored under the trunk floor.

We brined the Turkey last night and then started smoking it early this morning. While the turkey was cooking I headed over to the gym for a preemptive attack on all those planned calories. The lap pool was full when I arrived so I started with upper body weights instead, and boy am I glad I did.

I was on my second set of reps into my first exercise when I casually looked over and realized I was working out next to Arnold Schwarzenegger. Quick background: early in my life I badly broke a leg that put me in full leg casts for six months, and during that time I put on an awful lot of weight that I didn't work off for another 7 years. But I did drop those pounds and have stayed fit for another 25 years. My inspiration in those first critical years was Arnold through his movies, strength training tips, and health programs tied to the POTUS. Today I filled a personal dream and was able to tell Arnold face-to-face my story and thank him for his work in childhood health. It made an impact on at least one person. He was way cool about me interrupting his workout and thanked me for saying something. What an unexpectedly unique day.

I don't get upset when people have problems with GM. People have problems with every car company.

I do get troubled by the constant bashing that GM takes here and elsewhere from a certain bunch of people. They seem to be held to a different standard. Why that is I can only speculate. I have been a GM customer for a long time, over 35 years. I have had other makes in that time also. The most troublesome and undependable car I have owned in that time was a new Toyota - go figure. I have known some GM cars to be troublesome, but that is true of any make. It happens. What I get riled about are posts like those from a certain member here whose username begins with ""a"" that are simply generalized bashing, constantly, based upon what exactly, I am not sure, which he seems to have taken to heart. That is something to really be curious about.

Not much OPEC can do about it. U.S. has learned how to produce cheap shale oil. Truth is, we've become oil independent. Any oil we buy from any outside source is because they priced it low. They can try to raise the price. We just won't buy it.

Plus, demand is tepid, and looks to continue that way.

What the oil minister of Venezuela doesn't seem to understand is he can raise his oil price any time he wants. Having customers for it is an entirely different matter. Surprising given he is an ""oil minister"". No one ever said politicians were all that bright, though.
Exactly. I don't understand Saudi Arabia's long game. Get shale oil producers to stop pumping oil so that price goes up. Let's humor them and assume that shale oil companies don't innovate, etc., and stop pumping.

Oil price goes up as Saud Arabia wants, but at some point it will become economical for shale oil companies to start pumping again. So there's effectively a ceiling in the oil price.

Not to mention like you said, the demand is not there anymore."

Hey, thanks, guys for all of your ideas. I'm glad I got back on Edmunds a month or so ago, again, to get involved chatting about cars again. I used ta be quite a terror on here defending Kia's and Hyundai's. Didn't put down Daewoo's much, either. No, I'm not South Korean, either, nor part South Korean.

As to the question about Mazda's for sale in Dodge City...yes, there is a new car Mazda dealer here (I didn't know this until about a 1/2 hour ago, either) named G&G Motors in Dodge City. They have the new Mazda 2 hatch Mazda has named the CX-3 on sale here already! I could learn a little looking at one of those. They want a bit over $28,000 for the new hatch, however. There's a reason Kia's appeal more to me than Mazda's...one reason being this thing called price. Honestly, I'm not even selling the idea of a small $15,000 sedan from Scion to the Mrs., so I have no real liking for the new '16 Mazda CX-3. Price directs me a lot regarding automobiles (duh!!).

It is something to learn, though, that I have a dealer selling Mazda's here in this Midwest town of about 28,000 people. We are actually served well for new car choices here, just no Scion dealership for 150 miles from here. So, as most of you know, Mazda isn't selling the new 2 sedan in the States. They are partnering with Scion on the 2016 2 sedan. So this is going to be fun. The front end is perfectly forgiven by me. I am actually liking it. The Mrs. is not buying any idea about getting a new car, and, she is probably just about as stubborn as I am.

If I were to open an iluvmysephia1 separate bank account and start saving for a cash purchase, this idea of a CX-3 or iA would start percolating strong eventually, I think. So that's my story and I'm sticking to it. But I am really enjoying being back on here.

First, the front end will look different when viewed from where people see it. Not pretty when shown from much lower. The idea these days is to make grills distinctive so it stands out. And, it grows on you, at first it looks different, then it actually looks pretty nice. People thought the current Audi grills were weird, now they look pretty mainstream.

It is really sad when something goes so wrong and people can't afford to repair it. No easy answer. Your suggestion sounds like the best possibility.

It had a warranty for one month but they just fixed it enough so it would get through the warranty period.

I gave her the name and email address for a mechanic who writes a Q&A column in the local newspaper.

We like our beef, chicken and pork. I mean, I am really starting ta think like you did above in your question to me. I mean, when the '08 Mitsubishi Lancer GTS blew it's engine due to premature belt failure (that they're conveniently dissing coverage for in our case - because we didn't ""call them while SOL at the dealer with our dead Lancer GTS"". Right. No, they didn't say those words but they did say words to that effect. They are on my mud list and I stuck up for Mitsubishi while I enjoyed owning and driving our '08.

But, even in the Lancer GTS we had a factory armrest - I mean, really. I could easily order one on the net and fight with installing it and all, I'm up for that. But, here's what I was getting to. Viva Kia/Mitsubishi of El Paso sells Kia's and Mitsu's. I sat in the new '14 Soul (this was in early July 2014) and it was very comfortable. But when I sat in a '14 Kia Rio, it was not comfortable. And that is Kia's subcompact sedan offering. They want just north of $14,000 for the Rio sedan. But it was too small. I told my salesman ""no dice"" on the Rio.

Then, I asked about the Nissan cube, because I love that box. No kidding. They have a Nissan dealer but had no cube's at all! Huh? They didn't. So I asked if I could sit in and maybe drive a 2014 Mitsubishi Mirage 4-door hatch. I did.

Got a tip on a good tire store in Dodge....tires are next. Or, the 60,000 mile timing belt replacement should get done next. Then the tires.

We do have Frontier Kia here in Dodge City for service. It's maintenance, though, not covered under the Long-Haul Warranty. We're the Soul's 2nd owner, but bought a couple years extra Long-Haul to go to 10 years and 100,000 miles on the car. But, and it could be a big but, I'd better read my yellow owner's copy of that deal. The details could be revealing, there. I don't feel stuck with my little hamster, I do like it a lot. Not far off from loving the little 4-door. I just researched the iA to the n-th degree, and, I know the car would be a good fit for us. But would it be big enough in the front for us? Reviewers say there's good room up front.

Iluv, I had a similar issue with the Mazda 3. When the wife and I drove it together, it was just a bit tight up front. It really made more sense for us to get something a bit bigger. I just didn't expect to go huge! at least by my standards.

it did have a side benefit though. Sonata is such a roomy and comfy road car, we take that on trips. Pretty sure that would not happen if I had gotten the 3.

we also have an SUV for bulky duty. No way I could go without at least 1 car that was some sort of box.

Bingo, tommister2. Read my last post above, too. I am starting ta think that the 2016 Scion iA would not have been a good choice for us. We're on our 3rd Kia ('99 Sephia, '01 Sportage 4X4 and this '11 Soul) now and they are cars, vans and suv's that are built well. The Korean military uses the type of Sportage we owned, the '01 style. I don't know what they choose now, but no doubt there's HyunKia's in their stable somewhere. My point is that these are not ""Killed in Action"" vehicles at any stretch. They're built tough, to last.

Heck, I might even go for a 2016 or 2017 Soul later on. We're at 58,455 miles on our Soul now. Now for some pork, or beef. Don't get me wrong, we're not Pugs McGirk-sizers, we just like Midwest beef, ya know? I'm thinking the nice interior space the Kia Soul offers is more of a blessing than a throw-away.

What I would love and need ta do, of course, is test drive the Scion iA to get the best feel for the import automobile. That lies (at the best price, that is) about 388 miles to our west, in Denver.

There is probably a stored code for the incident in the computer, but I wouldn't worry about it unless it continues to happen. Some sensor probably went out of range (for whatever reason) and the computer was protecting the engine.

Interestingly enough, my new CLS came equipped with staggered sized Pirrelli Summer Performance Tires.  Never ever had Pirrelli tires on any of my Mercedes Benz vehicles - usually I get Continentals - but these Pirrelli's are also much quieter.  They are Pirrelli PZeros 255/35 ZR19 96Y XL fronts and 285/30 ZR19 96Y XL rears.  They really add to the handling and stability of the CLS.

My research showed that they are one of the highest rated Maximum Performance Summer Tires in production.  Great responsiveness.

If you have a mechanic friend whose services you use, I'd tell them ask much as you know and
see if they think it's likely to be terminal for the engine or if it can be rebuilt, the heads/block planed, and that might be good enough.

Our school buses constantly throw these error codes. We even get the little wrench. When some bus driver calls the garage in a panic they usually tell the driver to pull over and turn off the engine for a minute. This resets whatever sensor is glitching. Usually that's all it takes. If the same error reading doesn't go off or keeps repeating then they bring it in off the road. Usually it results from some fluctuation in voltage setting off bogus alarms.

GG, thanks for your impressions.
Generally, reviewers and buyers seem to really like their CTS's.
I thought if you liked it you would probably keep it. Usually it ends up in 1st place when compared to the competition.

Or, is it a matter of trust and ethics?

For ab it is very different, his car is working well and he trusts the brand, and most of the people who buy Caddies are liking them. If you get burned it is hard to go back.

I hope for Caddies sake they do have vehicles that provide a good enough customer experience that they retain some resemblance of a customer base. Otherwise Obama will have to make a speech that the next President will have to deal with this mess too in addition to Afghanistan.

The Audi fiasco is definitely nothing for them to write home about. However, remembering Mike's troubles with injectors couple of years ago, Benz's efforts to fix it would be something fo Cadillac to measure themselves against.
Can you really even compare a fight over clutch wear/failure? to unsafe non-functional steering, CUE, and more?

Also, Cadillac and GM strung @graphicguy / GG along for 7 months if this started in April, not 6 months.

Not surprisingly, I disagree. While pinning the blame on the dealer may have some covenient merit, the buck stops at GM. If they agreed to give their name to some shady or sloppy people, it's their fault for not vetting them, not enforcing the standards of care, or having such a bad relationship with them that they were not compelled to give an honest try to fix the car. If on the othe hand, it was the standard of care, that's even worse. If the relationsip with dealers is so bad that they can't touch the car without a ""code"", it is very much GM's fault. There is simply no scenario, under which GM can be excused here, even if the dealer (actually more than one) and various representatives were unable or unwilling to fix the car.

On a related, more general subject, Cadillac's dealer network is two or three times too big for the current volume they sell. It may be good for people to find better prices and improve access in smaller cities, but it also weakens and dilutes the premium brand experience. In current volumes, the dealers are bound to struggle financially and be compelled to foces on survival and gaming the system rather than satisfying the customer, souring what happens after the sale, which GG was a victim. His experience would be unacceptable at a Kia store, let alone at a store of a brand with such a legacy (even if somewhat faded) and aspirations.

HG failure will show up in the form of mixed fluids or leakage around the block. I'm not aware of HG design issues with the 3.7, though. I'd start cheap with the thermostat and new coolant, then measure the radiator with a thermal gun to look for cold spots that would indicate a clog. If the radiator looks good and thermostat doesn't fix it, then I would suspect the water pump or fan. The fan is easy to check since it should turn when the engine is hot. Pressure from the water pump is a little harder to determine and it might be worth swapping if the preceding things all check out. If the fan isn't turning, then he would need to isolate the fan and provide power to it to determine if it's the fan that failed or the temp sensor that trips the fan.

Since the car will lose 15% of it's value in year one, and 10% in year two, it would probably make sense to keep it for almost a year at least. Enjoy it while it is new and then decide what to do...it probably won't be worth much less 10 months from now.

It is really sad when something goes so wrong and people can't afford to repair it. No easy answer. Your suggestion sounds like the best possibility.

I wrote a while ago about our dog groomer lady. She works so hard and is so pleasant, has had so many problems in life, and she bought a used car and the engine was pretty well useless after one month. It had a warranty for one month but they just fixed it enough so it would get through the warranty period.

I gave her the name and email address for a mechanic who writes a Q&A column in the local newspaper.

The columnist has some clout and he (he can name the garage if they don't comply) got the garage to agree to get her car completely repaired to her satisfaction.

Back around '82 me, my brother and his wife were driving across Alligator Alley on our way to the east coast from St. Petersburg. We stopped for a break at a state picnic park somewhere along there. It was pretty desolate back then along that road, maybe still is, and this was one of the few places along the way that seemed OK to stop at.

We were sitting at a picnic table when we saw a number of gators walking along the edge of the road nose to tail heading for a waterway that bordered the park. A couple were quite large, with some smaller ones too. Probably 5 or 6 of them in total. We were very close to the car so we just watched and if any had begun detouring in our direction, we were ready to jump in. They ignored us though and crossed through the lawn, sauntered over to the edge of the water, and slid in. Scary.

Interesting article on Saudi Arabia, oil prices, their budgets, etc. Seems Saudi Arabia looks at how the price of oil supports their budget instead of what it costs them to produce. Their foreign cash reserves have fallen 11% in the past year, but they claim to be okay for a few more. The lower prices hurt poorer OPEC nations who don't have the vast reserves of $$$$.

That's exactly the case. There are economics of the oil itself, but there are also economics of those countries, where oil companies are state owned and oil revenues are essentially the revenues of the government used for all purposes. It costs Saudis single digits to produce the oil, but they need much more to keep the country together and not to lose their heads in the next uprising. Same thing with essentially all OPEC countries (worst is Venezuela) and Russia (not OPEC). Then there is Brazil - a special case, where Petrobras is this market-government hybrid (actually more like hydra) with gazillions in debt, cause they spent it all. Lots of private investors on the hook and a cesspool of corruption to boot. Similar with Mexico, maybe slightly better.

Right now we have a three-way supply shootout between Saudis, Russians and Americans. Saudis are taking revenge on Russians for overproducing (and market share gains) after 2008/2009 crash and trying to bankrupt American frackers in the process. They have cash reserves, but I would not expect them to be honest how much depletion they're really experiencing. I think it can go on for a couple of years. Saudis are really hoping for 2016 to be a judgment year for US investors in the shale business. They'll likely get it, if nothing changes. Oil sand production is already down, ocean rig count is down, the shale oil is still holding, some of those guys are actually increasing production, but just until the banks cut their credit lines, or the best wells go dry. Then we will see, who is left.

I feel the less cash reserves Saudi has, the weaker those in power are. Short term the US may suffer from the low prices. But when OPEC blinks and prices go back up some, investors will put money back in fracking and production. Not like the shale is going away and we lose the knowledge to ramp back up. In fact, with some of the new methods that lower cost or increase production, break even will stay much lower than over the past couple of years.

Not sure about that with GM cars. The odds of having early engine failure in the new Corvette seem to be pretty high, and I'd consider engine failure in the first 50,000 miles a lemon.

My little sister has a '13 Camaro SS Convertible. Fun, fun car. But, visibility is indeed pretty bad. And, the interior leaves a lot to be desired. Punishing ride on all but smooth pavement, too. Mustang is the better all around car, IMHO.

So, picked up the new CTS last night. Dealer had the check from GM as we agreed. Signed my title over to the dealer. Dealer signed the new title over to me. This was a deal done with the General Manager (GM) and F&I guy. GM asked what was wrong with my '14 to get Cadillac to do a buy back. Given management had changed at this dealership (last servicing dealer), he wasn't privy to all that happened before. I told him to drive it around the block.

I was the only customer in the dealership, so the GM took me up on my offer. He came back 10 minutes later and immediately said....""wow, how long have you been driving that car around like that?"" ""Since almost new"".

GM-""no one could fix it?""
GG-""why do you think it's being bought back?""

I had forgot why I bought the original CTS to begin with. The steering on the '16 is such a huge difference over the '14. Feels a bit quicker, but not sure why, given the dealer said the '16 has a little less HP, but same amount of torque. I figure it's because of the 8-speed trans on the new one vs the 6 speed in the '14. Either way, the new trans is much smoother. It reminds me of the auto in my E92 335i. That is, very good.

All the safety stuff is still there...lane keep, front and rear collision alerts, etc.

CUE is MUCH better. Car Play is great. Practically my entire iPhone functionality is on the indash screen and the voice recognition is a quantum leap better.

The ""on/off at stop"" function will take some getting used to. Out of all the cars I've driven with that technology, I will say the Cadillac does it best. Very quick and smooth stopping and starting. It's also defeatable.

Probably shop it around a little this weekend to see what a '16 CTS with 17 miles on it is worth used.
I'll repeat my earlier advice, drop it like a bad habit for the highest bidder. The last thing you want to do is go into the dealership for warranty service again, right? Even if they can fix the problems this time around; who needs problems?

I need to take my S4 in for its first warranty service finally at 37,000 miles. The windshield washer fluid tank leaks over being half filled. Let's start the Audi bashing now.

A dissenting view...

To say ""we bailed them out, but they haven't changed"" is not correct. They are building much better vehicles, and are a very different company with totally different management. But having said that, they are a mega-billion dollar corporation. You're in business, so you know what that means. They are not a charity, in the business of giving things away. They have many, many layers of management, who are responsible for turning in financial returns. It's just the nature of the beast. I seriously doubt any auto manufacturer would be much different. I think you hit the nail on the head with the diagnosis of the problem largely being the selling dealer. They do sound very questionable and Cadillac would be well-advised, I think, to reconsider whether that is the kind of operation they have representing them in your market. But as we all know here, the dealer system is always the weak link in any reputation chain between the manufacturer and the consumer.

Another dissenting view:

Let's think what required the bailouts in the first place. It was cars like what GG got. Lemons. Lemons that were either very costly to repeatedly fix (driving their cash reserves downward with high warranty costs), or that they ignored the problems of and lost customers most likely forever. They got a charitable bail out to keep them afloat. Now the same thing happens to new customers of the ""new"" GM. It is the fact that they are still doing what got them into trouble in the first place, building lemons and burning those customers with horrible product backing.

The dealer and manufacturer experience can be dramatically improved even on a faulty product with good after-sale customer support and service.

If you can burn customers and still stay in business because your lemons are few and far between then good for them, that's the free market at work. However, if you require bailouts on the regular (like Chrysler), it is not acceptable to continue this MO over and over.

When the light turned green, I decided to go in for a closer look (I figured it was probably one of those huge Iguanas with a long tale which are pretty common down here). Low and behold, 

I've lived down here for 15 years now. Sure I've seen alligators at the the zoo and animal parks, but never have I seen one in the wild (if you can consider Boca Raton the ""wild""). I dialed 911 on my cell to report the alligator to the police who in turn would contact animal control to capture this creature and ship him out to the Everglades (about 15 miles due west of me).

There have been hundreds of stories of missing cats, dogs and other pets (and sometimes even missing toddlers) who gave their lives to satisfy the appetites of many of these alligators. But it is essential to contact animal control so these ""killers"" can be removed from inhabited areas.

The police department thanked me for reporting the gator. They said they have received many reports of missing pets in the area and figured this was the culprit. Oh, the joys of living in a subtropical climate with all the pythons, iguanas, alligators and various and sundry other wild life moving about right under your very nose.

Alligators are nasty critters - much like bull sharks or great white sharks that inhabit the ocean on the coasts of Florida.  The pythons (15-18 feet in length) are multiplying quickly in the Everglades.  Pythons are not natural inhabitants of south Florida.  The are brought in illegally from South America and sold as exotic pets.  When these ""pets"" get too big, the owners dump them in the Everglades where there are no natural predators so the thrive and multiply.

Florida has allowed for Python hunts and alligator hunts because they are killing the Everglades by over-population.

I think I mentioned that the first time our family visited the Tampa area I was telling my younger son (about 14) to watch out for the gators. He gave me that teen look as if to say ""what the heck are you babbling about old man?"". As we pulled into the condos there was a 6 foot creature sitting on the edge of the retention pond. My son claimed it was made of rubber and refused to believe it was real until it slid into the pond.

That same week a jogger was grabbed by a much bigger one.

Personally, I'd rather wrestle every gator in Florida than go through another winter like last one where we had a foot of snow by Thanksgiving.

Not much OPEC can do about it. U.S. has learned how to produce cheap shale oil. Truth is, we've become oil independent. Any oil we buy from any outside source is because they priced it low. They can try to raise the price. We just won't buy it.

Plus, demand is tepid, and looks to continue that way.

Well, shale oil is not that cheap. If it were, you wouldn't have many companies on the brink of bankruptcy. Not talking ""big oil"", but many independent midsize US oil companies need oil price at 60-70 bucks to just break even. It's not just about the recovery being more expensive, it's also about their debt service. There are some that can live with $50 oil, or less, provided that they can consummate savings from their suppliers (sand, water) due to lower demand for those things. Many of those guys had hedges at $70+, which made them OK for the time being, but those hedges are running out next year. The bond market is clearly saying this - Chesapeake (one of the largest gas/oil independents) bonds are crashing.

Essentially, we are independent at $70-80/barrell ($3-3.5/gallon for RUG), but not so much at $40/barrel. Current production levels are unsustainable and will drop eventually, if the price remains.

Now, what the Baduro's henchman says, is entirely different thing. Being a socialist, that guy has no understanding of markets at all, let alone commodity market. He is basically calling on Saudis to turn the spigot off. OPEC is falling apart, cause all these guys need prices higher to sustain their budgets, but none of them wants to lower production to lose customers and marketshare. They all agree though to their primary goal, which is to thwart the production in the US - they may succeed, unfortunately. That supply was what brought the prices down, if it drops, we may see higher prices again/ It will take them a couple of more years, though, or perhaps even more, as Iranian supply may displace any missing US supply.

Thanks, driver.  That's an exact replica of what the new car looks like.  

Congrats Mike! I guess you were happy with the trade value on the E400? Knowing you they probably did an even swap

That would have been nice, but no - it was certainly no even swap.

They gave me $52,000 for my E400 trade (I paid $61,000 for it last December (was an even trade)

This one MSRP's for $79,000 and I paid $67,000 +++ less my trade value. I was very pleased with the pricing and it really helps to have those Fleet Discounts and incentives. Whenever you can pay $5000 - $6000 below dealer invoice for a Mercedes, it's a bargain, to be sure.

The technology on this new 2016 CLS is far advanced when compared to the 2015 E400 or the 2014 CLS550. The new screen is huge and the graphics and colors are all in HD. It has taken me about 2 hours so far to be able select settings, find weather and operate the NAV systems. But once I got the hang of it, it was/is impressive.

I did not get the Park Assist this time because it is a waste of money - we have no parallel parking down here where I live - maybe on the coastline and downtown areas - but I never go there. It has a back-up camera. I did not get the Driver's Assistance Package because for 2016, they have a new Accident Avoidance System which does almost the same thing - when approaching another car too fast or a pedestrian, the car will brake itself if you do not brake. Same with backing up - if it senses an object or individual, it will brake by itself if you fail to brake fast enough.

I did not get the massage seats because I used them so seldom (I had the E400 for 1 year and had 8500 miles on the car. Where do I go?

It does have the sport suspension and staggered sized tires - 19"" rims and summer performance tires. The car came with Pirelli Tires - first Mercedes I ever bought that had Pirelli's - they usually come with Continentals. Car handles like a sports car - had it up on the turnpike this morning early and it truly hugs the road - low profile. Since I am all alone now, and since no one sits in the back of the car, the small rear seating area is not a hindrance or negative to me. The front seats are larger and more comfortable than the E 400.

Insurance on the car is $45 per year more than the E400 which is not bac.

1970,November 2015,graphicguy,"dino...agree with you about one of the last bastions of socialism, Venezuela isn't very ""in tune"" with free markets (matter of fact, neither are those induviduals/companies who try to manipulate oil commodities).

I'll have to dig it up, but last report I got showed the huge gains in shale oil efficiency gains just in the last 12 months. That has driven down the cost of finding and refining pretty dramatically. The ""reasons"" we used to see for alleged oil runups have all proven false with North America becoming oil independent. The tragedy in France would have sent oil prices sky rocketing 4-5 years ago. Now, it wasn't even a blip.

Same goes for ongoing middle east tensions (which continue). The free market ignores those given there is no longer any credibility that's lended to them without collusion and price manipulations at play by financial markets.

Free market puts oil right where it should have been all along. Demand isn't going to pick up any time in the foreseeable future. Matter of fact, I can't see a scenario where it picks up at all given the fuel efficiencies of cars coming to market with alternate fuel and efficiency technologies coming on line.

Small gain, but even my '16 CTS has technologies I never would have dreamed of are in play. It's a relatively fast car. (sub 6 second 0-60) that so far, on a green drivetrain, is getting 24 MPG with me sticking my foot in it regularly (not a believer in ""break-in""). How is that done? Heck, the grill slats close to make the car more aerodynamic at speed, for example. Point being, more and more technologies are focused on performance while increasing fuel efficiency. Those were diametrically opposed just a few short years ago.

Big money has run away from oil. Some will probably come back as the shale oil producers become more and more efficient. Drilling is the ""old"" way of getting oil, though. OPEC is stuck with expensive ways of getting their oil. In order to survive, they'll have to get more efficient. They will, but more as a way to be competitive at lower oil prices vs just being able to raise prices on a whim.

As is always the case, the only ones in favor of higher oil prices are those affiliated with, or invested in, the oil sector. Other than that, the way oil is now, we're staying out of wars with oil producing nations. We're seeing the beginnings of another economic boom because of low oil prices. And, more money can be invested in other, much more important areas because of lower oil prices. It's a win-win!

Someone would have some serious 'splainin' to do if the price of gas started approaching $3/gal again. The Economic fundamentals just won't support it at that price. And, oil companies are making money at lower prices. They'll only get better at it.

I actually had an appointment for my first A Service for next Tuesday for the E 400.  I also bought this Mercedes locally - about a mile and a half from me.  That should save me 2000 miles a year in driving since instead of 21 miles each way up to Delray Beach, it's 1-1/2 miles each way to my new dealer.  They gave me the same pricing I used to get from my old dealer.

The experience was much more pleasant actually buying the car.  It was fast and professional at Coconut Creek Mercedes - I told them what I would pay (after researching the car) out the door and, after about 20 minutes, the GSM came over and shook my hand - ""...we have a deal...!""

I was incorrect about the MSRP on the car, it is actually $79,485. I just looked at the window sticker - I forgot there was a $1000 additional cost for the wheels I selected. So, I paid $67,738 + tax, tags and fees. So I got the car for $12,000 under MSRP. I have no complaints.

Some of the Malibu forum folks became obsessive compulsive about it when they got their 14/15 models. I found it shuts off so smoothly (on my 2.5L) that I don't realize it shut off. I just go with the flow and have gotten used to it. If I know the light will change shortly after my stop or I'm coming up to a stop sign, common in our area, I let off the brake pressure just before dead stop but don't release the brake completely. That lighter brake pressure keeps it from stopping the engine but still stops the car.

When driver100 said it was on his car, I hadn't realized how many companies had implemented auto stop/start. But the Malibu's use of it is so well done, that I didn't realize it had turned off and back on when I was doing the test drive loop. I had gotten off the interstate and made two stops at lights to take a back highway returning to the Chevy store. As soon as the brake pedal starts to release pressure on the brake system, the restart occurs before the brake has completely released. I have used that at a long light and let the engine restart without releasing the brake completely.

It's sort of like operating a PC compared to the Macs I used to use. There's a lot of control over the system. Now if I could only find a way to block repeat incoming scam calls on my wife's Android 4.4 Kit Kat phone... LOL. Had to install an app to do it. LOL
What would happen if you got the urge to blast off from the stop light while the engine was off? If you floored it would the thing come on with a bang sending gears in all directions of would it just sit there until the motor reved up and the transmission engaged?

Not that I go crazy off the line very often but I wouldn't feel comfortable driving a car that I couldn't do it if I wanted.

Say you are stopped at a light and your engine is off. If you want to get a fast start, the engine will start as soon as your foot comes off the brake, and then stomp it.

Even better, push the on/off button in when you are stopped, and the engine will be engaged and ready to go.

The engine my GM restarts as soon as the brake pedal starts up. If I want the engine to restart before moving I just release the pressure on the pedal keeping enough brake to keep the car from moving.

About the trans parts..., while the engine is off an electric pump circulates the coolant in the engine and a pump keeps the transmission fluid pressure up so the car is ready to go without stressing the transmission. I assume engineering in other car lines is similar. I've had the engine shutting down at a 4-way stop sign and I let up on the brake before it had died. The engine caught and was ready to go.

OF....don't know if I'll get used to the auto ""start/stop"" or not. Seems to make a difference in MPG. And, having test driven some vehicles with the same feature, I can say that Caddy's is the best implemnation of them all. But, it still sort of takes me by surprise more when it shuts down than when it starts back up (which is pretty darned smooth compared to the likes of BMW's implementation).

Kind of a nice feature at long red lights, though.

Some of the Malibu forum folks became obsessive compulsive about it when they got their 14/15 models. I found it shuts off so smoothly (on my 2.5L) that I don't realize it shut off. I just go with the flow and have gotten used to it. If I know the light will change shortly after my stop or I'm coming up to a stop sign, common in our area, I let off the brake pressure just before dead stop but don't release the brake completely. That lighter brake pressure keeps it from stopping the engine but still stops the car.

When driver100 said it was on his car, I hadn't realized how many companies had implemented auto stop/start. But the Malibu's use of it is so well done, that I didn't realize it had turned off and back on when I was doing the test drive loop. I had gotten off the interstate and made two stops at lights to take a back highway returning to the Chevy store. As soon as the brake pedal starts to release pressure on the brake system, the restart occurs before the brake has completely released. I have used that at a long light and let the engine restart without releasing the brake completely.

It's sort of like operating a PC compared to the Macs I used to use. There's a lot of control over the system. Now if I could only find a way to block repeat incoming scam calls on my wife's Android 4.4 Kit Kat phone... LOL. Had to install an app to do it. LOL

2032,November 2015,abacomike,"Sorry for abruptly leaving, but I have had so many problems with this new medication. They found out in my blood test that I was anemic from one of the drugs I am taking. So I had to have two units of blood IV to bring up my red blood cell count. That was Friday. I feel a little better, but still weak and I get out of breath very quickly after walking just a short distance. I hope I don't need any more blood.

But, all of you who said I would never, ever make it to an oil change on this Mercedes Benz E400 WON THE BET! I just bought a new 2016 Mercedes Benz CLS 400 in Diamond White Metallic and light (very light) interior leather seating with Piano Black wood throughout the interior. I never thought I would do this after having problems with the 2014 CLS 550 (visibility and height), but since I have lost so much weight, I fit perfectly in this new car.

MSRP was $78,495 and I paid $67,738. I had a $3500 incentive from USAA, a $500 incentive from Mercedes Benz Club of America and a $2000 credit from MBUSA as a gesture due to the experience I had last October with the build of my first E400. So, I paid approximately invoice less the fleet incentives and MBUSA credit.

This car has the V6 twin turbo at 330 hp and 3.0 L. When I test drove the car, it was more than powerful enough - sure didn't need the V8.

2041,November 2015,graphicguy,"WE had to bail out GM. As a result, they got a clean slate to do things the right way, which they said they would do.

Not sure they've been all that successful. In many ways, it's the same old GM. In my case with Cadillac, it was the same old GM...not stepping up to support their product and in fact, trying to sidestep fixing a faulty product.

Yes, that makes me angry. I dropped $40K+ large on what is supposed to be one of the ""top of the heap"" products that Cadillac, GM's premium brand, makes. It drove worse than a 15 year old salvaged Accent with 150K miles.

My belief is, given my Mother's issues that I took care of with Cadillac, and now my own personal issues, yes....I'm allowed to bash.

Some asked about the original selling dealer. It's an inner city dealer. They're stand alone, and they aren't owned by any bigger conglomerate. They were shady 10 years ago when I was dealing with my Mother's Cadillac dealership. Given the dealership personnel (dealing with the family who owns the dealership) I was working with and the fact that every car my family bought from them seemed to have more than just delivery miles (usually a few hundred, up to a 1,000 miles), and was listed as ""new"" tells me there was something amiss. Couldn't quite put my finger on the problems.

So, drove around last night. Initial impressions are the same. It drives a hulluva lot better than the '14. They've quietly updated the amount of content, without raising the price. Apple Car Play is just one update that makes the CUE system eminently more functional. CUE is way faster, too.

""Start/Stop"" will take some getting used to. But, out of all the cars I've driven with that technology (BMW and Mercedes), the Cadillac's is the best implementation.

The CTS always handled well....very well, as a matter of fact. It has a very nice ride/handling feel. Some of that I would think comes from the magnetic shocks. If I had to do over again (which will NEVER happen), I'd get the 19"" wheels. The upgraded 18"" I got are better than the 17"" that are standard, but I would want even more tire.

Most companies who are making AWD vehicles (which seems to be everyone in this segment) have also adopted the torque vectoring that was originally brought to the mass market by Acura and Audi. Cadillac has their own version. They all work well. You can take corners at a higher rate of speed than you think is possible, and the car just tracks the corner.

It feels quicker, as mentioned before. Mentioned I always liked the 2.0T. I do love those torquey turbo motors. The Cadillac's is a good one. I think the 8-speed trans has a lot to do with the quicker feeling. My guess? Upper 5 sec range 0-60. Certainly not going to scare any 6 cyl turbo motors out there, but quick nonetheless.

Steering is smooth and responsive with good road feel. Hard to believe I put up with the steering on the '14 as long as I did. I drove it so long that I had almost forgotten how it was supposed to drive.

1/2 tank of gas in, computer says I'm getting 24 MPG. Not sure about this CTS, but the last one's computer was deadly accurate in stating actual MPG. In the '14, I was getting on average about 22 MPG. Initially, this one looks to get about 2 MPG better. So, the 8-speed and the auto start/stop are doing their thing, apparently.

Overall, good car, made better.

That won't stop me from trading it the first opportunity. I've been screwed by Cadillac for the last time.

GG, thanks for your impressions.
Generally, reviewers and buyers seem to really like their CTS's.
I thought if you liked it you would probably keep it. Usually it ends up in 1st place when compared to the competition.

Or, is it a matter of trust and ethics?

We loved driving the A4, and we got it repaired and could have kept driving it, but we just didn't trust the company or the car any more. It sounds like you might feel the same.....good car but when you lose the trust, how do you still enjoy your car?

For ab it is very different, his car is working well and he trusts the brand, and most of the people who buy Caddies are liking them. If you get burned it is hard to go back.

To say ""we bailed them out, but they haven't changed"" is not correct. They are building much better vehicles, and are a very different company with totally different management. But having said that, they are a mega-billion dollar corporation. You're in business, so you know what that means. They are not a charity, in the business of giving things away. They have many, many layers of management, who are responsible for turning in financial returns. It's just the nature of the beast. I seriously doubt any auto manufacturer would be much different. I think you hit the nail on the head with the diagnosis of the problem largely being the selling dealer. They do sound very questionable and Cadillac would be well-advised, I think, to reconsider whether that is the kind of operation they have representing them in your market. But as we all know here, the dealer system is always the weak link in any reputation chain between the manufacturer and the consumer.

ab, I have a slightly dissenting view too.

The dealer may not be great, but it is ultimately the responsibility of the actual company to fix the problem. Please don't say I am bashing....Cadillacs are obviously well made good cars, that are beautiful and well designed.

But, when the dealer didn't come through then the manufacturer should have been there to see what the problem was. No one should have to go through what GG did. That's not bashing, those are the facts. Cadillac can make the best cars in the world, but, if they build a faulty one they have to fix it, or the warranty is useless. If all car companies are the same, then we should be careful with any car we buy and we have to cross our fingers and hope we got a good one....but, I wouldn't risk buying from a company that I know doesn't stand behind their product.

Not surprisingly, I disagree. While pinning the blame on the dealer may have some covenient merit, the buck stops at GM. If they agreed to give their name to some shady or sloppy people, it's their fault for not vetting them, not enforcing the standards of care, or having such a bad relationship with them that they were not compelled to give an honest try to fix the car. If on the othe hand, it was the standard of care, that's even worse. If the relationsip with dealers is so bad that they can't touch the car without a ""code"", it is very much GM's fault. There is simply no scenario, under which GM can be excused here, even if the dealer (actually more than one) and various representatives were unable or unwilling to fix the car.

On a related, more general subject, Cadillac's dealer network is two or three times too big for the current volume they sell. It may be good for people to find better prices and improve access in smaller cities, but it also weakens and dilutes the premium brand experience. In current volumes, the dealers are bound to struggle financially and be compelled to foces on survival and gaming the system rather than satisfying the customer, souring what happens after the sale, which GG was a victim. His experience would be unacceptable at a Kia store, let alone at a store of a brand with such a legacy (even if somewhat faded) and aspirations.

RE: Restart.

I turn it off as soon as I start the E400. If I forget, I do the same, gently remove my foot from the brake before it totally stops. If I come up to a long light or a train for example, I press the restart button, brake a little harder than usual and the engine shuts off.

I think the car might even learn my habits and just doesn't bother turning the engine off most of the time. Not a big deal, just disabling it when I start, and it is kind of nice to have the engine shut down if I am stopped for a few minutes.

Not as big of a deal as it sounds.......you kind of get used to it and expect it after awhile. I think it has to be a bit detectable, as the car kind of rumbles to a start and off. Sometimes hard to tell when it is off, and I check to see the tach is at zero to make sure engine is off.

Not surprisingly, I disagree. While pinning the blame on the dealer may have some covenient merit, the buck stops at GM. If they agreed to give their name to some shady or sloppy people, it's their fault for not vetting them, not enforcing the standards of care, or having such a bad relationship with them that they were not compelled to give an honest try to fix the car. If on the othe hand, it was the standard of care, that's even worse. If the relationsip with dealers is so bad that they can't touch the car without a ""code"", it is very much GM's fault. There is simply no scenario, under which GM can be excused here, even if the dealer (actually more than one) and various representatives were unable or unwilling to fix the car.
IIRC the problems began to be experienced in April - after the dealer had already replaced the original car for reasons that were never fully explained, as far as I can recollect. When the second car began experiencing problems we heard one side of the narrative but we obviously do not know the entire story. Once the buyback button got pushed I imagine things changed rather dramatically in the dealer/manufacturer/customer equation. None of that excuses GM but the end result after about 6 months was that the customer was put into a brand new car 2 model years newer with some cash to boot. That is not too bad. Compare that to Driver's experience with Audi or other manufacturer stories we have heard here over the years.

They were thinking that for every unhappy customer who will fight for 8 months, 1000 will give up, so they are still further ahead by a long shot. What they don't think about is the magnifying affect, people hear about it here, and they tell others too. Soon, sales start going down, because there is a general attitude that they would rather abandon their customers.

They only gave GG a new car because they knew he would win if it went any further, and they probably would have had to pay treble damages. They were probably happy to get out of it by trading.......they are trading a new car but at cost price.....not a huge loss for them.

Kind of disappointing. Their big discount amounted to less than 8% on some pricey loaded models. I can see some of these still being on the lot this time next year.

2066,November 2015,graphicguy,"My little sister has a '13 Camaro SS Convertible. Fun, fun car. But, visibility is indeed pretty bad. And, the interior leaves a lot to be desired. Punishing ride on all but smooth pavement, too. Mustang is the better all around car, IMHO.

So, picked up the new CTS last night. Dealer had the check from GM as we agreed. Signed my title over to the dealer. Dealer signed the new title over to me. This was a deal done with the General Manager (GM) and F&I guy. GM asked what was wrong with my '14 to get Cadillac to do a buy back. Given management had changed at this dealership (last servicing dealer), he wasn't privy to all that happened before. I told him to drive it around the block.

I was the only customer in the dealership, so the GM took me up on my offer. He came back 10 minutes later and immediately said....""wow, how long have you been driving that car around like that?"" ""Since almost new"".

GM-""no one could fix it?""
GG-""why do you think it's being bought back?""

I had forgot why I bought the original CTS to begin with. The steering on the '16 is such a huge difference over the '14. Feels a bit quicker, but not sure why, given the dealer said the '16 has a little less HP, but same amount of torque. I figure it's because of the 8-speed trans on the new one vs the 6 speed in the '14. Either way, the new trans is much smoother. It reminds me of the auto in my E92 335i. That is, very good.

All the safety stuff is still there...lane keep, front and rear collision alerts, etc.

CUE is MUCH better. Car Play is great. Practically my entire iPhone functionality is on the indash screen and the voice recognition is a quantum leap better.

The ""on/off at stop"" function will take some getting used to. Out of all the cars I've driven with that technology, I will say the Cadillac does it best. Very quick and smooth stopping and starting. It's also defeatable.

Probably shop it around a little this weekend to see what a '16 CTS with 17 miles on it is worth used.

Which engine is that? I didn't realize any other engine in GM's lineup was using auto start/stop. The 8-speed transmission may be the same one getting good reviews in the new Camaro; someone posted a link to that in this forum or another.

The start stop on my 2.5 engine does not engage if I let up on the brake pressure just before coming to a dead stop--still keeping pressure on to stop, but not using the full force of a normal traffic stop. Some people on the Malibu forum go crazy trying to defeat the auto start/stop in some way. It becomes their goal in life, sort of like those who worked to defeat DRLs. But the easy method is what I just suggested. Of course, you could bypass the hood latch detector so it thinks the hood is open.

Glad to hear the saga is over. It's interesting to hear the GM's reaction.

I have to disagree that because GG and the Cadillac dealers had a long, drawn out buyback fiasco, that the generalization can be made that a defective Camaro would meet the same fate. Different division of GM, first of all.

I still think there's a dealer component to GG's problem because of the near downtown selling dealer--there's something fishy there. This is the kind of advertising that money can't buy: but it's been the wrong kind of advertising for Cadillac division.

What kind of buyback experiences have people had with problematic cars from other companies? I recall back when I bought my 03 that a few Accords were bought back by Honda because of the popping noise when the body twisted in a driveway transition to street situation. The one I test drove did that, along with a few other things I didn't like, such as wandering, feeling every pebble through the steering and chassis, and wind noise.

2103,November 2015,graphicguy,"Thanks, guys. Fact is, we all spend a lot of money on cars. I can't think of any other high buck purchase that I've ever had to put up with the level of problems than I had with Cadillac.

You buy a 65"" UHD TV, and spend a couple of thousand, if it has issues under the warranty, and they can't fix it, you return it. Why a car is any different, I don't know.

In my case, it was the combination of the attitude of Cadillac and the dealers' disinterest or inability to fix it that made it so frustrating. None of us buy cars in the hopes we will have problems with them. We buy them because we like them. And, we spend a lot of money doing so.

It shouldn't matter if it's our HVAC system, our toaster, our TV, our computer, or our car. If it doesn't perform, stalls, steering fails, electronics quit working, either fix it or take it back.

This whole situation could have gone an entirely different direction (at least a more positive one). After the 3rd attempt to fix any of the issues, Cadillac could have just admitted that there were things wrong that they just couldn't fix at the dealer level. Insead, they denied there were problems (only to later admit that there were problems, like the stalling issue).

Not sure what culpability the dealerships had in this fiasco, given I've heard others tell the same story, deny problems exist, minimize the customers' concerns, turn the blame back towards the customer as being the culprit. That's not a good way to do business.

Instead, they chose to irritate and frustrate me. Why? Who knows? In the end, it cost them more to do the swap out, than it did if they had just admitted the car had issues they just didn't understand, and returned my money to me.

Trading the car right away? Maybe! Will see what is out there come end of year. I don't even know what I want to replace it.

That said, nothing has been finished. I'm supposed to get the check and give my '14 CTS back to the dealer today and pick up the new one. At least, that's what Cadillac Corporate set up to happen.

Instead, they chose to irritate and frustrate me. Why? Who knows?
Because they thought they could. How many people would have given up and moved on? In their bean counter mind it pays to do what they did, because it works majority of the time and the money lost on once-in-a-while ""GG-type"" is not enough to change that. Moreover, who knows, you may have lied, they had to go through all motions to make sure you didn't. Your aggravation and disappointment is small price to pay (for them of course, not you). It's sad, but it's understandable in the myopic world of corporate policies, or dealer-manufacturer relationship dynamics.

It's all a dance of maneuvers and of knowing the most (and least) effective ways of directing your resources (aka, time, energy and money).

2106,November 2015,graphicguy,"Mr Shiftright....agreed.

Dino...Auto manufacturers', and to a lesser degree, their dealerships, seem to treat their warranties like suggestions. Cadillac has whole depts set up to run interference and resisteance between those who have problems with their cars, and the company. Even the process of getting resolution to issues is built upon insulating Cadillac from any sort of negative customer experience.

First you go to the dealer (numerous times). They can't solve the issue, you can't even go to corporate yet. You have to go through the BBB. They call the dealership. Dealership fields complaints and rehashes the same old tired lines....""operates as designed...can't duplicate problems....etc"". Then, it's back to BBB, who escalates it to Cadillac Corporate, who in turn refers you to another dealer. Then, the process repeats itself, over and over.

Before you know it, you're 6 months into the issues with the car, have been bounced around from dept to dept, been through 3-4 different business entities (dealerships, BBB, Cadillac Corp, etc) who have stonewalled you, and it's no wonder people just give up, as you point out.

This sort of treatment just solidifies my resolve. It tarnishes Cadillac's (already fragile) reputation and no doubt, causes them to lose sales.

There were so many opportunties along the way for Cadillac to have turned a negative into a positive, and they dismissed every one of them.

Regardless of the business you're in, that's not the way to conduct it. I tell the people who work for me (and the people I work for) all the time....""I've never known a business to fail by listening to their customers.""

Steve...I agree. In this situation, mandatory arbitration did nothing more than stall the inevitable and make a bad situation untenable. They actually went so far as to schedule the hearing at a time when I told them I couldn't make it to the hearing. Thanks to some of the suggestions here, I agreed to attend the hearing via the phone. Had my paperwork all filled out, all the receipts, all the dates my car was out of service....in short, my ducks were in a row. But, there was no arbitration that actually happened. Once Cadillac saw I was willing to go to arbitration, and there wasn't much they could defend, then their stance changed and could actually be seen as conciliatory. It never should have gone that far, though.

With my wife's A4, she lost confidence in the company, and she just wanted to get rid of it. So, we ended up paying $1200 of the $2300 bill. But, I think they actually did us a favor. If we went to trade the Audi in today it probably dropped more than that in value.

One of the nice features, new for 2015 -- the tailgate locks and unlocks along with the doors when using the key fob. Very, very nice.

Also new for 2015, the steering wheel is tilt and telescope, not just tilt.

Henryn, I am glad you added the edit as I was wondering what vehicle you were referring to.

I am surprised the earlier 150 wouldn't have a telescopic steering wheel, do they think all truck buyers are 6'2"" and 250 pounds?

You might ask your neighbors for the name of a reputable indie shop who can do all your routine care as well as any other repairs that might crop up. Oil is oil but some of those quick lube joints are pretty sloppy and I'd bet the filters are not OEM spec.

Then they always recommend oil changes in about 1/4 of the time they needed to be done, and I always needed a new air filter, brake fluid or wipers even if they were new.

I have a really good indie shop nearby and you reminded me about that, so that is where I'll go.

**You also reminded me they found one regional chain of oil change places that totally ripped off customers. Some ex-employees told how they had to sell huge amounts of extras to keep their jobs, and they got commissions (very small but could add up) for selling stuff.

2138,November 2015,graphicguy,"OK....I think the lemon '14 Cadillac CTS story is about to come to a close.

Last I posted, the dealership (not the original purchasing dealership) who was working with the GM Repurchasing Center had sold the car I wanted....a 2016 CTS Performance model. It was the only one they had in a 2016 (they did have a leftover 2015 that I wasn't interested in).

After a bit of give and take, GM agreed to let me purchase the CTS Luxury model (which was less expensive) and give me the dollar difference. Kind of convoluted because there are all sorts of fees and tax implications, but GM is FedEx-ing me the check (supposed to arrive today). I signed their agreement on Monday with the caveat noted if the check wasn't what we agreed to, or the numbers aren't right when I pick up the new car at the dealership, no deal.

I think Cadillac is somehow reimbursing the new Cadillac dealer for making NO money on the '16, in addition to making me whole on the price difference on the two cars, plus the change in incentives.

Bottom line, I had driven the luxury version of the CTS. Drives about the same as the Performance version given the magnetic shocks come with the Luxury version if you get the upgraded wheels and tires (which are indeed on my car). I did really like the ""umber"" leather in the original Performance version, but I'm good with the tan leather in the Luxruy version I'm getting. I'm giving up the digital dash, which is OK by me, too. Aside from that, the Perforamnce and Luxruy versions are about the same.

My thought process, I just want to put this behind me, get rid of my still broken '14 with no money out of my pocket. I did that, and then some! Fair? From my perspective, Cadillac corporate fought me tooth and nail. They wouldn't authorize their dealerships to fix my car right. In the end, it probably would have been cheaper for them to just return my money, as I had originally requested. Insteand, they now have my old car, which will be labelled as a Cadillac buy back (not sure if it would be titled a lemon, as car companies try to stay away from that word). In return, they sent me a sizeable check, plus they gave me a car that's two model years newer with no money coming from me.

I'll probably pick up the '16 tomorrow after the dealership gets the PDI done. This could have gone a lot better. Original selling dealer seems to have some sort of ""grey area"" in which they operate in. Found it with my Mother's Cadillac over 10 years ago, and again with me on the '14 CTS. Can't quite put my finger on it, but they seem to have cars.;....new cars, demo cars, etc that have an inordinate amount of issues. I think this has maifested itself past the point of being coincidence.

Never dealt with the new dealership, except this time. New management came into play and things seemed to get rolling once they were involved.

I suppose given the amount of cars this group buys and sells, crazy situations are bound to arise.

2139,November 2015,driver100,"GG, great news....that it seems almost over. Of course, it isn't over until it is over but it looks pretty good right now.

My guess is this Caddie dealer you are getting the car from is a top performer, and HO got them to do this as a favor, and they'll get something for doing the prep and paperwork.

The other dealer is probably one HO is planning on dumping, or just is not very high in their books.

You are right in your case it would have been better to solve this earlier and just take back the car or switch it out. However, you are the 1 in 500 who fought to the end, most people would have given up a long time ago and so in their eyes that will continue to ignore their customers....they are still ahead overall.

Hopefully this car will be one of the good ones and you will enjoy it and get a lot of miles and satisfaction from it. Caddies are beautiful, I love the look of them, but, that isn't the way to build a brand.

You fought the battle and won. I think the BBB or arbitration was the tipping point, they probably told GM they weren't going to win this one. If they had won then the whole arbitration lemon law thing would be a total joke.

I think they will sell the lemon off to an auction or an indie lot, GM won't want that car to be connected directly to them.

I think they will sell the lemon off to an auction or an indie lot, GM won't want that car to be connected directly to them.
In an earlier post GG said something about the vehicle going to GM engineering (Warren, MI?). There I would assume it will be driven and its behavior monitored with proper equipment to determine just what has been going wrong. Subsequently it will be fixed and given to a vocational school for training purposes.However, in the process GM will have learned what the other Cincinnati urban Cadillac dealership didn't learn or didn't want to fix.

Our local area JVS auto department has several such vehicles from various manufacturers, including the ones who build ""perfect"" cars. Same for a community college with an auto technology department that feeds from the local JVS. They cannot be titled and have been donated by the manufacturers.

I have suggested doing some checking of the VINs in online Ohio records of titles for the two Cadillacs GG has had to see if there's any hint of how the one dealer seemed to have cars with problems. It reminds me of when our friends bought a low mileage ""demonstrator"" Jetta from a VW dealer in Northern Cincy. They could never get the engine light off. It spent weeks at the selling dealer.

2144,November 2015,graphicguy,"Thanks guys. We'll see. It ain't over till it's over. Did a very brief test drive of the '16. 8 speed trans vs the '14's 6 speed. Feels quicker and is certainly smoother with closer gear ratios. Not sure if this is a GM design, or they xource it from the likes of ZF, but it's a better transmission over their previous 6 speed.

CUE...big improvement. Not sure what happened with the one in my '14. It just stopped working. I guess if I would have made more of an issue, they eventually would have replaced the entire CUE system. I just got ot the point I didn't care anymore, though. Apple Car Play is very nice, simple and will render Navigation systems from the car manufacturers' obsolete. My guess is the manufacturers will want the revenue from the expensive Nav option, but will have a hard time charging for it. So, I'm betting they'll start charging for the screen and interface to Car Play to make up for it. Anyway, certainly makes the Nav much easier to use and functional.

Remembering what the steering was supposed to feel like is pretty amazing. I had forgotten what it was supposed to be like. As much as they tried to fix the power steering, they never really did, entirely. It was still ""problematic"" in my '14. It just wsn't as problem prone as it was initially.

The one thing they DID finally fix (after 5 tries) was the stalling. It hasn't stalled in several weeks.

Right front suspension seems to be an issue, now. Almost sounds/feels like a busted shock. Not sure. Don't care. Rides and sounds like a suspension with 200K miles on it (not 10K like it does now).

Not certain what they'll do with the '14. Originally, they told me they were sending it to Cadillac engineering. But, who knows? It could end up on a BHPH lot with a ""buyback"" title. It still looks great. Someone, somewhere will fall in love with the style and not care about checking the CARFAX. Then again, from what I've heard from some of you here, CARFAX can be ""scrubbed"".

Anyway, yeah...I'll get some pics after I make certain the transaction is done.

I saw a 2016 Maxima at the car wash and I thought it looked pretty good. They took some risks and came up with a pretty unique design, especially the interior.



Then I read the review on Edmunds and by the time you get it the way you would want it you may as well buy a Euro luxury car with much better handling, RWD, has CVT. Are they joking, anyone who knows anything about cars wouldn't settle for a Maxima.

Honey Bees

I was starting to think the bees are coming back. I spend all day, every day outside during the spring and summer and have noticed more honey bees this year than in the past few years. I read an article yesterday that says I'm wrong.

Neonicotinoids are used by farmers on about 140 different crops, including corn, canola and soy. But despite truth-twisting marketing from producers, there is little evidence that 

Copyright 2015 U.S. News & World Report

http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/opinion-honeybees-are-dying-and-our-food-supply-will-go-with-them/ar-BBmXQ52?li=AA4Zjn

Maybe Old Farmer, or others who spend a lot of time outdoors, can chime in - Am I just having hallucinations?
Hard to say if nicotine base pesticides are the cause of honey bee decline. It certainly is toxic to humans. I do know that Carbamate pesticides are really really toxic to bees and are sold over the counter at Walmart. Have been for 50 years. If anything was going to do it that would be my guess but I think mite infestation is a bigger problem for domestic hives.

I gave up my pesticide applicators license years ago when the re-certification requirements became too burdensome. While I still use some OTC bug killers I found that my wife feeding the birds in winter took care of a lot of bugs when they started sticking around all year.

I think the days of farmer's carpet bombing fields with chemicals are over. The new trend is toward biologicals, beneficial insects and IPM.

Saw a Vette that put a spring in my step this morning at the Chevrolet dealer. I asked the sales manager if it was a Chick Magnet. He said it was but he didn't know if they would be able to get up out of the seat once they got in because of their age... Price $104 K.




The black Vette they had on the floor the last time I was there was bought by a fellow in middle 70s who traded in a 2011 Orange (Gold) Mustang--3000 miles on it. Manual transmission. Hope it's had an annual oil change. But it's not really due, based on mileage. LOL






Forget the Vette (as beautiful as it is) and grab that Mustang. Something like that is my holy grail; low miles driven gently by an old coot. I doubt a guy in his 70s was spinning it around in the high school parking lot to impress the girls or taking it to the track on weekends.

I am saving it for you....not for free, I mean first crack at it!

2 things I really miss on the Passat compared to our newer cars, 1) rear camera and 2) blind spot warning.

Once you get used to those features it is hard to drive without them. Backing up the Passat I can line it up pretty good, but not to easy in a lot where it is hard to see the white lines. But, what is really nice with a rear camera is the distance....you can see where the rear of the car is.

About the Mustang, I would probably prefer it to the Vette, I think I am just practical enough to want rear seats just in case, at least a bit of a trunk, and easier access getting in and out. And 1 in 3 chances of getting a lemon is not very good odds.

I believe the Mustang is manual. $27000 asking. The son talked the Vette buyer into taking the one that was automatic in black that had been on the showroom floor because he didn't drive the Mustang because of the manual trans.

The red Vette can't even be driven here now because it has racing tires. No good below 30 deg F. But the warranty on the Vette is good even if you race it, because the car and options are designed for racing. No thanks.

What happens to those tires if you drive below 40? Do they disintegrate or just lose some performance? Is it only the ""Extreme"" types or do the ""Ultra"" high performance suffer the same limitations?

I know the P Zero Nero all seasons on the Ford develop flat spots if the car sits for a few hours below freezing as did the Bridgestone HP AS on my Eclipse. Smoothed out after about a mile. That I could put up with but spitting off chunks of rubber not so much.

Those designations are kind of confusing. Extreme, Ultra, Max performance.

Tires in the ""Extreme"" or ""Track"" categories lose their grip at low temperatures. Some are made of rubber compounds that crack at low temperatures.

Well, I dunno. Canada has banned the chemical that is in weed and feed so we are now a dandelion paradise compared to 10 years ago. It really is unbelievable how they have taken over. But the bees do not seem to notice as the same stories as your son's GF cites appear in the media all the time. Something isn't adding up.

When I mow the outfield I occasionally see a honey bee so I stop the tractor until he's done doing whatever he's doing then I proceed. That happened a lot this past summer. In the previous 3 or 4 years I didn't have to do that very often.

What kind of bed cover are you thinking of? I thought very hard about a camper shell, and I still may go in that direction, but for now I just settled for a soft tri-fold tonneau. I got one for $242, delivered, and it fits quite well and looks pretty good for the money.

It is not water proof, but is fairly water resistant. And it is definitely not theft proof, anyone with a pocket knife could gain entry -- but the same is true for convertibles. It is very easy to put on, and take off, and is light weight and very easy to store.

Thanks, I can't see it on my small screen laptop. So you buy an Altima, and they are going to let you have a Sentra or Rogue for 12 months which must be at least $3000 a year or $6000 for 2 years.....does that seem possible? Also, who would take the Sentra over the Rogue?

Maybe the trick is the buy back price of the leased car...or that you agree to lease it longer. There has to be even more of a catch.

My neighbors looked at a Civic, lease deal was $119 a month. Salesman told them up front they never lease a car for that, by the time they did the add ons it came to $250 a month. I could have told them there is no way they would get a lease for $1500 a year.

No, you get the second car for 24 months ... but, I'd also guess that you have to pay MSRP for the Altima.

Has anyone else had a full installation of Windows 10 as an update?

Mine was upgraded to Windows 10 a couple months back. But
now it has an upgrade to the new Windows 10.

Mine didn't do the Windows 10 update on the first try, so I tracked it on the retry last evening.
This morning it's doing a restart which is an installation, complete with multiple restarts
and the same screen as the original Win 7 to Win 10 upgrade.

EDITED:
It has run what acted like the first installation. Took about 30 minutes.
When done it acknowledges that all things are where they were, etc..
Must have been a big update to Windows 10. So instead of doing an
update, they did an upgrade installation again.
My PC's 8.1 install has been a bit screwy ever since a virus attacked it. Windows Update has been dead for months, and it won't download windows 10. I'm probably going to use my laptop to download a copy of 10 to a USB drive and see if I can upgrade my PC that way.

Wow, 217k miles and they still offered $6000? I would have thought a truck like that would bring scrap value ( no offense).

Are trucks these days retaining a higher value than they used to? I've been checking CL for cheap trucks to replace my van (133k miles) and most of what I find in the under $3000 range have over 150k and are heavily rusted. The rust doesn't bother me as much as the miles. Everything in NY is rusted.

So, dealership and GM Repurchasing center calls yesterday.

Price delta is about $8K. I would get a check from Cadillac for about $8K, plus the car.

Given I don't plan on keeping it, I just want a car that's reliable at this point. They didn't say no. But, I have yet to see the new offer letter that is supposed to be sent.

GG.....hat is going on? You supposedly picked out a car that you were willing to swap for....and now they sold it out from under you? So, is this the new game they are playing? You keep reserving a car and they keep waiting until it gets sold. I would think part of the deal should have been they would reserve that car for you until the paperwork was done. This makes it even worse....now they are bigger liars and cheats as far as I am concerned.

What kind of business model is that? Hold onto a unit until it depreciates beyond any hope of selling at a profit and then play hard to get with the only interested customer.

Last October I visited the Ford dealer only 3 miles down the street to inquire about Mustangs. The salesman acted bored, told me ""they won't be in stock for a month"". He claimed there were no brochures available. I even left my number a email (which I never do) and asked for contact when something arrived.

Actually, I found a lot of salesmen don't call back Those are probably the one's that won't last too long in the business.

Life insurance people have to call back 7 times to become really successful. The first time they get about a 14% average, it goes up each time after that to over 80% after 7 calls. Not too many salespeople make it to the top tier.

Just a suspicion, but I think the foreign luxury car salespeople are trained better to follow up. I assume they have more training and know the importance of calling back...that has been my experience.

I would agree...the bad guys can cut off heads and kill innocent civilians but we have to go by the rules of war.

In business I always tried to be as honest as possible. Then I came up against a liar and a thief. I agreed to something and then on advice from my lawyer decided to change my mind.

All this is enough for me to think that maybe, for some sort of twisted political reasons, we don't really want this war to end. Maybe the pentagon is using it for practice for when we have a tougher enemy, or maybe they want to keep the munitions people happy by selling more guns and ammo, or maybe they like getting funded to develop new and better weapons, etc. It just seems to me that if we wanted to end this nonsense, we could do it in about 2 weeks. The U.S. can be very ruthless when necessary and I think it is possible that using political correctness in this war is just a convenient lie and excuse to keep it going.

Good point...I am high pressure averse too. In the case of the insurance guy calling 7 times it is not pressure. It is used to help build a relationship of trust. No high pressure. Just a hello, are you satisfied with your current supplier, and build a little more with each call to see if you can offer something more suited to the customer. High pressure turns off most people these days.

I have to add, it should be done in a truly helpful way, never setting up a con.

I related this story a few months ago, but a friend of mine in our small group at church is a diehard Corvette enthusiast, and bought one of the first C7s. When he was looking at the car that he ended up buying he asked the sales guy if it had Magnetic Selective Ride Control and the sales guy said yes. He bought the car and-just like the two Car and Driver Corvettes(Lightning Lap and Long Term), his C7 needed a new engine- at 6000 miles the rod bearings were shot. To add insult to injury, while looking at his disassembled pride and joy in the service bay the tech told him his car did not have MSRC. The dealer stepped up and let him trade for a car with MRSC at an extremely good price because he was a loyal long-time customer. The new C7 has been flawless.

If that were me I would no longer be a loyal customer after being lied to like that, that is unless the dealer simply swapped out the cars at no additional cost. This is why it is best to get things in writing.

Well to be fair there is a correlation between the two, just not a 100% correlation. The price of gas has to follow the ups and downs of oil as the price of oil is a major component of the price of gas. But since there are other costs involved in the price of gas which are more consistent in their price the price of gas wont change as much as the price of oil.

If they refuse, simply wipe them from the face of the earth. Harsh medicine, but that is what we had to do to solve the Nazi problem back during simpler times, and that worked.

Absolutely!

Grandparents came through Ellis Island. First my Grandfather, then 15 years later, my Grandmother, Father and Uncle. But, my Grandfather had to prove a record of solid emplyment and no felonies while here (...they couldn't care less about any record he might have had in his native Italy). Once he was established, they allowed him to bring over the rest of his family.

From the few pictures I saw of my Grandfather in his early days, he initially lived in a two room hovel with no running water. Worked 7 days/week with only Christmas and Easter off. But, that allowed him to put a little money aside to send for the family and buy a teeny house that had running water.

U.S. needed laborers. Immigrants provided that....almost to the point of indentured servitude. That brought about labor unions, but that's a whole different discussion.

2289,November 2015,bwia,"Speaking of low oil prices.

A couple of weeks ago I drove past a Gulf Station selling PUG at $1.97. Fair enough I said to myself but driving a couple more miles down the road on Route 1 in Norwood, Mass I came across a Tesla dealership once occupied by a Lincoln dealership. Yes, a regular dealership with cars on the showroom floor and an assortment of cars in the parking lot.

As they say timing is everything. In this case I think Tesla might be too late to the party. With gas prices so low an electric car looks like an expensive alternative. Besides, the Model S design is getting ready for a refresh or a totally new design.

The no-dealership concept was a nice sales distribution gimmick but moving away from it relegates Tesla to just another car company. What next, a super-hybrid?"

Some details on the truck. it's a 2014 extended cab FX4 model and really black.
It had 44 miles on it when I took my test drive.
It has pretty much everything you can get on a truck (msrp over 51k).
Lots of truck stuff, like off road package with terrain control, trailer towing, skip plates, side step bars, tailgate man step, kick out side steps, bed liner. Ecoboost 3.5 with 3.55 locker rear axle, 20 inch rims on A/T tires.
Also, lux stuff like power moonroof and rear slider, power folding side mirrors(nice), heated/cooled seats and NAV.
Traded the Escape and got reasonable money for it, a little more that Edmunds highest number, probably could have gotten more, but it was close.
Doc fee went to $499 from $399 in January, but I guess they have to pay for that new building somehow.
Just opened last week. On the sales contract, printed on the doc fee line, 'This is not negotiable'.

2297,November 2015,graphicguy,"bwia...big difference with Tesla...they are factory owned stores, not franchisees who own the stores.

I think Tesla is making cars with an approximate 300 mile range and sports car performance. To my knowledge, no one else is doing this at the same price point. They are selling cars direct, and sidestepping franchises as best as they can, and gaining ground in doing it.

Their battery products alone will propel them to success.

I believe someone asked about symptoms of Alzheimers in this topic. The

And third, use of unique words declines. These were observed by analyzing
Reagan and his use of words in press conferences looking for early signs.
Also anesthetics can increase risk of Alzheimers.

I tend to disagree.  There is a correlation, but not 90% or even 80%.  The AAA reports that for every dollar change in the price of a barrel of light crude, the pump price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline will increase or decrease approximately 2.2 cents.

So, it sounds to me that the American Automobile Association, which keeps detailed records of the price of a gallon of gasoline at the pump and the cost per barrel of light crude, says there is a correlation.

I hope we're gonna see things continue to plummet downward where they belong. By all rights of...pretzel logic, to quote Steely Dan, ghastly prices ought ta be about 65 cents a gallon.

I'll 2nd that....never be influenced by one or two who may disagree. If we all disagree with you then it may be time to leave

I think more would agree with what you said regarding the price of oil/gas ratio. I find when the price drops it shows up fairly quickly, but is very small difference compared to what the price of oil actually drops. Many costs are fixed, transportation, refining, marketing, real estate, staff, etc., so the price change at the pumps is small compared to the drop of a barrel of oil.

They report the price gas every day on the radio back home, usually if a barrel drops $2 or $3 they say the price at the pump will drop tomorrow by 10 cents....something like that. They even know so closely they will actually say, don't fill up until tomorrow, or the next day.

If we take the number of native speakers it would be Chinese (Mandarin), if we take the number of people who speak it as either a native or second language I do believe it is English. However Spanish would also work in this respect as IIRC it has the second highest number of native speakers. The rational of using a widely used language is that fewer people would have to learn it and it is already ingrained in large areas of the world. If we create a new language then everyone would have to learn it.

2340,November 2015,graphicguy,"Was flying home after a conference yesterday. Irritating, to say the least.

I like an aisle seat. That's what I book. While I'm ""exposed"" for when the flight attendants come flying down the aisle with a beverage cart, I also have one side open to me so at least a portion of my body has a little room.

Anyway, I'm boarding. Get to my seat. A lady is already in it.

GG: Excuse me m'am but I believe you're in my seat.
Lady: No, this seat is mine. I have the aisle seat.
GG: (showing her my ticket) Perhaps you're in another row?
Lady: (looking at my ticket and ""harrumphing"") Oh...OK! (moves to the window seat).

Another lady comes up and questions the same lady about her seat. Well, as expected, she had the middle seat. So, she rearranges herself again, complaining to me and the window passenger that she's claustrophobic. I suggest she see the flight attendant for another seat.

Flight is full, so no new seat for her. Two hour flight. She starts the ""whine"" while we're still at the gate. I put my ear buds in, plug into my iPhone to listen to music and read a bit on my iPad. Now that means the only person she can whine to is the lady in the window seat. I see her animanted conversation, not really hearing what she was saying. Except, once airborn, the flight attendant makes a special trip to our row. I pull out my ear buds to hear the flight attendant politely but firmly, chastise my middle row seatmate if she doesn't quit, they will detain her at the end of the flight.

This lady was probably in her mid 30s. Not sure what her deal was. I don't think she was drunk, but clearly unsuited for modern air travel. She tried to recline her seat, until she did so with such force, she spilled the drink of the passenger behind her. She was constantly up and down, going to the lavatory. In general, she was a nusiance, to the point where we were deplaning and the security personnel whisked her away to some very loud protests by her, and hand clapping by her fellow passengers.

I fly a lot. First time I've seen that.

I used to do a little work on my laptop while on a plane. But, given the airlines have decided to make the amount of room you have equal to a two hour stay at Guantanamo, I don't even try anymore. I get Car and Driver on my iPad. So, I like reading it while flying.

They blasted VW in the latest issue....mentioning what most of us were thinking, why did they do it? Bottom line, they thought they could get away with it. And, since much of their world wide business is based on diesels, it was worth the risk. Lots of open ended questions and concern over their future viability once fines are levied and law suits are settled.

Same issue, they blasted the 40,000 mile test drive of the newest Corvette...saying they couldn't remember a more trouble prone long term test. I guess the engine self destructed at one point. They also pointed out that it was unsuitable for cold climates as they had a heck of a time getting it to start when cold. Electrical glitches galore and some fit foibles. They mentioned how long it took to fix and diagnose, too. They said for the money, it's a great bargain. But, not worth it for the quality issues.

Sounds like GM has issues spread throughout all of their brands. And here I thought my problems were limited. GM is going down the same path they went in the '80s and '90s. That's not a good thing.

2344,November 2015,imidazol97,"Just finished a good book, Killing Reagan by Bill O'Reilly. Thorough, containing
good and bad. I had enjoyed Killing Patton when I read it earlier. The book
mentions Alzheimers a lot.

I believe someone asked about symptoms of Alzheimers in this topic. The
epilogue mentions that. As far as vocabulary, there may be 3 early hints to the sharp
readers or listeners. First, is use of repetitive words. Second, increased
substitution of pronouns instead of specific nouns, such as ""it"" or ""thing.""
And third, use of unique words declines. These were observed by analyzing
Reagan and his use of words in press conferences looking for early signs.
Also anesthetics can increase risk of Alzheimers.

Several weeks ago I was at lunch by myself at ChickFilA. I observed a worn out
appearing gentleman in his 70s assisting a woman across the traffic lanes from the parking.
She appeared to be an age to be his wife. He seated her in a booth near the cash registers.
He then approached the end register ahead of a line of 6 people and I was first in line.
He walked up to the cashier to place his order, jumping the line. She had looked at me,
but when he moved in she winked. I am on a first name basis with most of the cashiers and managers.
We both saw he was frazzled and in poor health; the lady he assisted in
looked to be in great condition, physically.

Later I walked by where they were sitting and he was entertaining her playing
a repetitive hand game much like one would with a child in younger years, and
she was laughing. I'm certain she was typical of the Alzheimers patients and
he was the caregiver who was endangering his health taking care of her. So sad.

Driver....I've traveled a million plus miles on one airline (Delta) and probably that many miles again with the other airlines I fly. I think the current situation with airlines is untennable and are going to swing back the other way shortly.

In Cincinnati there's a charter company that flies to NYC, as an example. They do it out of an older, but easier to navigate airport. Prices are competitive with the big airlines and no hassles whatsoever. No inept TSA to deal with, either. I use them when I can.

I used to fly about 100K miles/year with Delta. Now, that is spread across several different airlines, including charters. So, Delta ultimately loses. They don't see that, though.

Corvettes.....I know if I had just dropped $70K on a new Covette, and the engine self destructed, no way I would want it fixed (C&D had Chevy put in a new engine, but they don't own the car). I'd be all over Chevrolet for a buy back.

Cadillac update...still no word directly to me, but apparently the dealership is getting quite a bit of paperwork. They may have a buyer for the car I wanted. That's OK with me. But, it did bring up another proposal that the dealer actually made. If I took a ""luxury"" CTS instead of a ""Performance"" CTS, and Cadillac reimbursed me for the price difference, would that work for me?

Something to think about, especially given I probably won't keep the car that long to begin with.

""The current scientific consensus is that solar variations do not play a major role in driving global warming** since the measured magnitude of recent solar variation is much smaller than the forcing due to greenhouse gases. Also, solar activity in the 2010s was not higher than in the 1950s, whereas global warming had risen markedly. Otherwise, the level of understanding of solar impacts on weather is low"".

But the gov has allowed a diminished competitive situation that allows this along with higher prices. Probably the only way to improve it is to allow foreign carrier competition on domestic routes, lust like Japan coming to the US ended up improving Detroit's game. However, in all fairness maybe we get what we bring on too. Some years back when the tightening legroom started, American kept extra legroom in Coach, but paid for it by charging around $10 more for a ticket each way.

So, Cadillac dealer called and asked if I had seen GM's letter yet. I haven't. They said they received notice to prepare for the return of my old CTS and return it to Cadillac engineering.

Just read the CR article on the diesels. I found this particular piece interesting: "" it is a matter of shifting resources from commercial truck emissions—as big rigs are the source of most on-the-road pollutants""

Sounds typical to me. spend lots of time and money chasing after what gets the most attention, instead of what makes the most impact.
Couldn't agree more. If they ran the same real world tests on all cars, like they did on the TDI, my bet is at least 50% of them would not pass due to defeat codes or some other reason. VW should insist on this.

I am in favor of thorough testing of all recent gasoline burners for pollution as well as mileage. We have the Kia/Hyundai scandal with high EPA mileage figures having to be corrected.

I put having a car from a company like that in the same bag with one who's had transmission problems where they replaced the transmission twice at 80K miles and they've extended the warranty to 100,000 miles so that the next failure after that of a problematic transmission likely to fail at 120K miles would be at owner expense. And worse, like a religion, the owners taut the brand as the best thing since sliced bread. They all put their wheels on one lugnut at a time.

Question for those who have gone thru major electrical work like I just had done:

What is the standard for cleanup of the work area afterwards? I think I know the answer but I would like some feedback before I contact the contractor's office.

The upstairs areas were fine when the two young electricians left, but I only took a quick look downstairs as they were packing up and didn't really inspect until today. Most of their work was in 2 carpeted areas. Most big trash was picked up, but it was littered with cut-off wires about 1"" long, lengths of bare copper ground wire, knockout plugs, and lots of general tiny debris. They left behind a 3 foot section of the service conduit along with the box the new panel came in as well. They didn't ask for a vacuum and didn't bring their own, but I went through 2 full vacuum dirt containers before it was presentable. I also found 4 or 5 1/8"" pilot holes in the kitchen hardwood where they were trying to find a stud bay to route a wire. It is right next to the shoe molding so it isn't very visible and really not a big deal to fill - but it would have been nice if they had told me and apologized.

Thoughts? They seemed like good guys and I think they just wanted to get out of here last night when they wrapped up around 6:30 - today is a holiday and I heard one of them saying he was going away. But this was pretty messy. I should have taken pics before I cleaned it up but I don't know what it would do for me.

Ab, the best workers I have ever used take pride in what they do and they leave the place cleaner than when they came.

These guys may have been competent, but, they aren't in the top tier. Good workman care enough to make it seem they weren't even there.

A response from a spouse like, ""...if you want it, go buy it..."" means only one of two possible hypotheses:

*""...I love you and you should do anything you want that makes you happy...""

*""...If you come home with a new car, you'd better make sure the trunk is big enough to fit all your belongings in because you are moving out...!""

When I would share with my wife that I was looking at a new car (even though the one in the garage that had my vanity plate on it was only 9 month old), she would always say, ""...do whatever you want!..."" In ""spousese"" that means if you buy a new car, you're a dead man walking!

@robr2, kind of scary to think of the monthly bill for a maxed out 200 amp service. Need to play with my Kill-A-Watt gizmo here.
Maxing out a panel doesn't necessarily mean much use. My brother added toe-kick blowers in each bathroom to move air from the hot water baseboard heat that was now behind the vanities as well as electric heaters built into the fans. That alone was 4 circuits. Overkill IMHO. His kitchen has 2 outlet circuits, 1 the range, 1 for the wall oven, 1 for the kick-toe blower, 1 for the lights, 1 for the dishwasher, 1 for the disposer, 1 for the lights, and 1 for the vent - that's 12 panel slots as the range and oven are 240V.

My kitchen has 7: 2 outlet, 1 dishwasher, 1 disposer, 1 gas range, 1 vent, 1 lights. My panel is probably at 90% full as it includes 2 furnaces, 2 AC's, and an unused dryer connection. My typical electric bill is $200 a month."

The E400 hasn't been washed since the big trip. I took it to America Car Wash and they do a fair job, though I don't think the young people work as hard as they used to. Their was lots of dirt behind the rear wheels on the lower rear panels, and there were wipe marks on the wood finish on the doors. I don't think they vacuumed the trunk. This was the Gold Wash....2nd from the top.

Also, some little really old lady came through in a blue Camry, she could hardly drive. Somehow got in the wrong lane and came up behind the cars getting their final cleaning....and right behind my car! I was in panic mode........she could hardly steer and she was pretty clueless....only in Florida. One of the attendants moved a few pylons so she could circle around again and get in the correct lane. It's hard to miss it, but, there is no way that lady should be driving a car.
Car washes have gotten really lousy. I think the problem is people put up with the mediocre at best work. If more people complained about the same thing, or forced more re-work of the same thing 2 or 3 times over until they get it right, then they probably would change the Standard Operating Procedure.

@oldfarmer,
Looking for an F150, but taking my time, wife and I have looked at a lot of them.
May not end up buying anything, but most likely a 2015, if I do.
However, the quotes I asked for are for 2014's.
If I don't like the numbers, I'll just cross them off the list, but they are not your average trucks, which is probably why they haven't sold in 2 years.
You got me thinking about whether there were any new 2014s left and the nearest ones I could find were 500+ miles away in Ohio. The three I located were all super loaded $50k and up but they were only discounting them $3500 or so.

Doesn't make sense to be so cheap on a truck that is worth at least 25% less just from depreciation.

And I bought my 2013 F-150 for just over 21% off list including dealer discount and rebates at the time, in 2013! So the prices you are finding are not competitive at all. If that dealer doesn't put more money on the hood, his 2014 trucks will continue to be furniture.

Of course I was just looking at the Ford inventory web site so maybe if you were actually standing in the dealership they might offer more but you'd think on old lot queens they would want to advertise their best price. After 2 years I can't imagine they're waiting for that one customer who will pay top dollar.

Yep, that's how I interpreted the statement - nothing partisan about it.
That's exactly what I meant. People often have a strong need to belong to something and at that point they accept their group allegiance as overriding any independent judgment they may have otherwise. Once a R or D than the favorite candidate can do no wrong and the opponent is not even American, or he/she is obviously a foreign agent (must be, by definition, as he/she is from the opposing party), his/her presidency simply cannot be legitimate (who would vote for him/her - I don't know anybody, do you? It must have been rigged then, that's the proof.). Admitting to anything, even the smallest thing, is like saying ""I'm wrong"". It's not even really a political passion, it's more basic tribal instinct. Same instincts are visible in Afghanistan, where it doesn't matter whether the boy killed or raped the girl, it matters whether he is my tribe and she is somebody else's. The difference is modern states have ways of channeling them and corralling them into something easier to control, plus placing mechanisms allowing just people to detach from their tribe, should it be necessary.

Similar thing happens to car brands for some people - once you are BMW/GM/VW guy than any transgressions of ""your"" brand are ""no big deal"", ""exaggerated by press"", ""media conspiracy"", yet, when the other brand does it, then suddenly they have to be shut down and locked up.

That's interesting. Our house also had 60 amp fuses. When we upgraded to breakers I told the electrician we wanted 200 amp service. He said we didn't need 200 amp and talked me into 100 amp service. He also went on to say that 200 amp service is for real estate agents selling a house, not because people need it.

The house is almost 3,000 square feet and have never had to reset a breaker.
I'm doing this as prep for a heat pump installation as a starter, with the possibility of a bump-out or other renos later. The difference between 100 amp and this was only about $300.

Part of the issue here was half-a***d renos done over the years by a former owner. The main panel in the basement ended up in a clothes closet, a real no-no according to code here. They found the 220V cable going to the stove had a splice in it that was just stuffed up in the joists, no junction box or anything other than some Marrette wire nuts. And of course nothing was grounded. The original metal service pole on the side of the house was actually rusted. It was a mess for sure, so I don't mind the investment. It would hit me at the end anyway if I ever decide to sell.

Wow. When I did the demo to remove soffit boxe above the cabinets in our galley kitchen, the electric stove needed to move over about 2 feet. The wire to it was aluminum despite the rest of the house's wiring being copper. The electricians working days at Lowes told me not to put in a junction box to move stove over and to abandon the aluminum wiring and put in a single run of copper.

Gotta love the experts that Lowes used to have working days in plumbing and electric departments.

What is the standard for cleanup of the work area afterwards? I think I know the answer but I would like some feedback before I contact the contractor's office.

The upstairs areas were fine when the two young electricians left, but I only took a quick look downstairs as they were packing up and didn't really inspect until today. Most of their work was in 2 carpeted areas. Most big trash was picked up, but it was littered with cut-off wires about 1"" long, lengths of bare copper ground wire, knockout plugs, and lots of general tiny debris. They left behind a 3 foot section of the service conduit along with the box the new panel came in as well. They didn't ask for a vacuum and didn't bring their own, but I went through 2 full vacuum dirt containers before it was presentable. I also found 4 or 5 1/8"" pilot holes in the kitchen hardwood where they were trying to find a stud bay to route a wire. It is right next to the shoe molding so it isn't very visible and really not a big deal to fill - but it would have been nice if they had told me and apologized.

Thoughts? They seemed like good guys and I think they just wanted to get out of here last night when they wrapped up around 6:30 - today is a holiday and I heard one of them saying he was going away. But this was pretty messy. I should have taken pics before I cleaned it up but I don't know what it would do for me.

Stride: walk with long, decisive steps in a specified direction.

The problem is if VW/Audi cheated here on gas models as well as diesel, have other brands also used deceit in the testing on gas models as well.

Andres, it's really not a matter of ""point of view.""  It has to do with what's right and what's wrong.

We all have to be careful not to use synthetic reasoning - using unproved or unsubstantiated information or data as ""fact"" and then go on to refer to that info to prove or disprove a hypothesis.

If an automobile manufacturer has to design its engines to pollute 10-40 times permissible levels of emissions to gain an edge on horsepower and fuel economy, everyone gets cheated - the owners of those vehicles, the people who have to breathe those pollutants, the people who buy the polluting vehicles as used cars, etc.

It's just a matter of looking at things from ""various"" and ""alternative"" points of view.  If VW had taken a more realistic and scientific approach, taking into consideration the possible consequences of cheating in determining whether or not to build engines that ""cheat"", they would have not built those engines.

It's just a shame that they allowed this to continue in order to be more competitive.  VW stated that it was a group of mid-level  rogue engineers that caused this fiasco and that upper management had no knowledge of the ""cheat chip"".  I find that hard to believe when considering 11+ million vehicles are affected - but if they didn't know about that chip, that doesn't say much for their management.

My point of view was that if you don't alter the vehicles then HP and fuel economy remain the same, and the only ""cheated"" variable from this point of view would be emissions. Based on that theory, if one (any owner) didn't attribute a value to ""clean emissions,"" then one is not truly ""cheated,"" at least in a monetary sense. I suppose they will let lawyers and judges decide on these semantics.

Thanks everyone for your replies. Mike, last year you gave me excellent instructions and I got it going right away.

This time I couldn't get the needed amber light, no matter what I did, and I spent almost an hour. Then I was on the phone with first level Homelink rep for almost 2 hours We tried every combination and probably wiped out my settings for the 2 garage doors at home. He gave up and sent me to level 2, a nice young lady.

Then 2nd lady tried for 1/2 hour then asked if I wanted a break. I had dinner, got a new battery for the garage remote, and she called back in exactly an hour and a half. I think she researched the problem.

Her fix was to ignore the wrong colored lights...I never got an amber. Hold the button, it went green, then red, then flashed green. When it is flashing hold remote near and press remote.

The next step would have been to go to MB dealer, but she got it fixed. She did say new Mercedes seemed to be harder than average to program.

Read today that this is the 50th anniversary of the 1965 Northeast blackout.
My memory of that is changing the channel on the TV, the lights going out and my parents being mad at me for a few minutes. I didn't get to touch the TV much back then, so it seemed like a double whammy.
I remember that. Here in Nova Scotia our lights did not go out that night. But I remember as a 9 year old being at home with my grandmother. It was a Tuesday night and my parents normally went out that night to a regular social event. My grandmother and I were in the living room watching TV and the lights dipped and flickered for a moment, long enough to make her wonder out loud what was going on. Later on there was a news bulletin that cut in to tell us the first news of the blackout. I remember feeling a little scared because at that stage nobody knew why it happened or if it would spread.

Speaking of electrical things, I just had my house electrical service upgraded to 200 amps from the original 1950s 60 amp service. Two days of work by 2 and sometimes 3 electricians. This is the first step of doing a number of upgrades here over the next few years. The new panel is gigantic compared to what was here before.

Hold the two outer homelink buttons down until the amber lights flash - that will clear the memory.  Then, while holding down the specific link button on the mirror that you want to control your garage door opener with, place the transmitter next to the mirror and press it, release it, press it, release it and repeat that about ten times until the Amber light on the mirror flashes.  That should set the memory.  If it doesn't, it's not the car that's at fault.  Mercedes may have to send a tech out to sync your car to the garage opener's antenna.

This is hitting closer to home, so I checked and the Passat has a 2.5 litre engine. The 1.4 l is in very small models;

Tuesday’s findings over carbon dioxide emissions, and petrol-fuelled cars, are understood to involve smaller 1.4-litre engines, mostly in the VW Polo and Golf, as well some Seat and Skoda cars, and the Audi A1 and A3.

A change in the CO2 emissions of the vehicles would also affect their fuel economy, VW admitted. ""It was established that the CO2 levels and thus the fuel consumption figures for some models were set too low during the CO2 certification process,"" the company said.

The company said it would “endeavour to clarify the further course of action as quickly as possible and ensure the correct CO2 classification for the vehicles affected” with the responsible authorities.

And, of course, the usuall blah blah blah,

“The board of management of Volkswagen deeply regrets this situation and wishes to underscore its determination to systematically continue along the present path of clarification and transparency,” it added.

Why don't they just say we got caught cheating our customers!

Unless a customer considered emissions in the purchase of their vehicle, I don't see the customer being cheated.

I know I'm going to regret responding to this post, but as I have said before, ""...sometimes you just gotta do what ya gotta do...!
 
Andres, when you make statements like, ""...Unless a customer considered emissions in the purchase of their vehicle, I don't see the customer being cheated..."", do you ever look carefully or reread your statement before posting it?  Only someone who has only one way of looking at things or is short-sighted would make a comment like that!

Think about this for awhile:

I buy a Mercedes-Benz because of the luxury, handling, technology and comfort.  I then find out that my fuel economy is 25% worse than the EPA estimate because Mercedes-Benz purposely under-reported CO2 emissions by 30%.  Would I feel cheated even though I did not buy the Mercedes-Benz for reasons of fuel economy or emissions?  You're ""darn"" right I would feel I was cheated!

I buy a new refrigerator for more interior space for food and the convenience of a side-by-side format so I don't have to bend to see what's in the freezer.  I find out a month later that my electric bill is 18% higher than in previous months.  The only change in use is the new refrigerator.  I check the label and it has an energy saver rating of 87.  I call the manufacturer and find out the refrigerator I bought actually has a rating of 53, but the labels were misprinted.  Do I feel cheated even though I did not buy the appliance for the energy savings I would experience?  You're "" darn"" right I would feel cheated!

Are you starting to understand why your statement is thoughtless and short-sighted?

If you don't see that, then all is lost by my ""teaching lesson"" for the day!  

You are not comparing apples to apples, but oranges to apples. In my examples the apples are free to the customer, while in yours they cost money. If my mileage drops 1% or my performance .1 seconds to 60 MPH from 0 MPH, you are darn right I'd be livid at the manufacturer. However, if owners do nothing to alter the vehicles, then the cost to the owner's is zero for VW's transgressions. Unless of course, you can prove you died early from lung failure due to that TDI motor spewing fumes. I don't think anyone will be able to prove that.

Exactly....right on dino!
I can't disagree with Dino's statement. VW for sure pulled a fast one. I just know that I'd be MUCH MORE angered if they were lying about gas mileage or HP than the current lie about emissions. The goodwill gesture they are putting forth is an excellent ""good-faith"" first step that goes a long way to establishing some trust.

The RX8 with its overstated HP saw the same effect, which is to say nearly no effect. And neither of those cases made any impact on the dealers like this VW debacle has.

OK! I surrender, I see your point of view now, and as an affected partial owner (wife drives it) of a recent TDI vehicle that falls in the scam, it's in my best interest for VW to cough up as much dough as possible to customers. That means coughing up as little as possible to the EPA as I want it to go to customers. Sometimes I think the only thing gov't entities are interested in is the almighty dollar though, and somehow thing many at the EPA don't give a hoot about clean air and would rather pocket a big fine from VW.

I know the CA DMV will take your registration payment and allow you to ""defer"" your smog check an indefinite unwritten amount of time. You can't be a day late with the money or penalties will be imposed, but it's OK if you are late with the Smog certificate.

I'm not a big fan of low profile tires, but vehicle designers are. They like the way a large surface area of metal appears - and not the way black dirty rubber looks.

@driver100 Hope you missed the backups in Cincy. I checked 5-6 pm on maps.google and there was the heavier than usual Friday backup before the 75-71 bridge with all the folks traveling south for various reasons. On the KY side of the river was another major slow area in red due to accident IIRC.
Just going from memory but I think we were there around 4 pm. The GPS lady said to start moving to the right but by then the line up went way back. I had to slow down a lot in the next lane over to the left, and then when the right lane started up I just wedged myself in front of a slow starting up truck. Then another guy got in behind me. Once we rounded the curve we moved quite well over the old bridge. At least with 4 lanes it actually was moving pretty well. We did hit a bit of a slow down after the bridge. But, overall from Dayton through to Lexington although busy moved really well....mostly at 80 mph in the left lane. Not too many police around in that area. I found if you travel in a pack and go with the traffic 80 isn't a problem in 70 zones, but I try to keep it at 78 just to be a bit on the safe side....2 miles slower per hour isn't going to make much of a difference on a 500 or 600 mile a day trip.

Thanks for the info though....it was a big help in knowing what to expect. I keep hoping one day the repairs will be over and there won't be construction zones or pylons.

But, overall from Dayton through to Lexington although busy moved really well....mostly at 80 mph in the left lane.
The section from Dayton to Cincy is 65 mph, not 70. It's fun to see the State Patrol cars picking up the many people who treat it as 70 and drive 75 and more. The patrol is creative at picking locations to run their radar or laser. Glad you made it through that and Cincy.

I do remember the 65 mph zone too and there cars were going 75 in the left lane. Police didn't seem to bother them. I usually use a 10% rule, so I wouldn't go more than 72 around there.

Thanks again for the heads up....I was extra careful and just stayed in a pack. It is nice not to have to worry about getting caught for speeding.

By higher you mean a larger number allowing more runout and more variation in pounds of stiffness? Not a higher, tighter requirement meaning a better tire?
Yes, not a better tire. The reason for this is 2 fold.

1) The vehicle manufacturer wants NO warranty for vibration, so they typically have tight specs.

2) New vehicle owners are typically much more fussy, so the levels where complaints start is higher."

Nice! Are you allowed to disclose what kind of projects you worked on? What's your take on the trend to low-profile tires?
I worked on a lot of project in over 40 years, but I am more of a generalist - what do tires do and how do they do it.

I'm not a big fan of low profile tires, but vehicle designers are. They like the way a large surface area of metal appears - and not the way black dirty rubber looks."

2573,November 2015,fordfool,"A couple of thoughts on original equipment tires and mileage. Tires designed for comfort, i.e. to sell cars, tend to be softer with more flex. Performance tires are softer and wear much faster than tires designed specifically for high mileage. And as the front end wears (alignment, ball joints, steering arms, tie rods, shocks, etc.), the tires will wear more quickly as well.
I try to keep on top of suspension / steering issues and replace OE tires with high mileage tires, so tend to get greater mileage from the replacements."

Unsolicited rant re OE tires - they stink! I'm convinced that vehicle manufacturers just get the rejects from the tire manufacturers for their new vehicles. They don't come with their own mileage warranty, even when replacement tires of the exact same brand and specs do. Those replacements will usually go about double the mileage too. Guess I'm just burned up that I had to put a replacement set on my daughter's Optima yesterday at 21K, and that I had to spend $ on a leased car that will go back in 15K miles. The particular brand that came on this car (Nexen) probably didn't help. Had never heard of it before; appears to be a cheap Korean brand.
I went to a seminar for Goodyear once...they were fishing for employees. Thank goodness I wasn't accepted.

They told us the best grade tires go on new cars so people will buy them again for replacements.
2nd grade goes to retailers but not their own stores, have to keep the big tire guys happy,
3rd grade goes to their own stores, they can't refuse them.

Don't know if that helps.

I don't know if there is any truth to this. I do know that printer manufacturers (HP, Brother, etc) include a very small toner cartridge. Does maybe 1,000 pages, and then they sell you a new ""full size"" toner for more than you paid for the printer in the first place. The way around this is to make sure there are aftermarket suppliers for the toner BEFORE you invest in the printer.
It's been shown that though aftermarket printer refills are cheaper they don't do as many pages.....really not any cheaper.
We bought aftermarket cartridges for our business until one exploded and it took our IT guy a day to clean up the printer.
The aftermarket dealer gave us a refund on the portion of the cartridge we hadn't used yet, nothing for the time to clean our printer. I told him to take his cartridge and never come around again.

Friday got to Lexington KY, about 550 miles.
Saturday got to Valdosta GA, about 550 miles.
Should be in Tampa tomorrow afternoon, about 500 miles

Traffic near Dayton was good....heavy, but speed limit is 70 and fast lane is going 80.
Lots of old broken up tires just off the road, wouldn't want to have to pull over fast. This was in Ohio, Michigan is a lot worse.....roads look much better once we hit Kentucky.

Also a few dead deer there too, I counted 8 with a few in Georgia.

Gas is between $1.99 and $2.15 for reg. Back home it is about $4+

The E400 drives like a dream. I told my wife it almost drives itself, I just guide it.
Gets 30.6 mpg on the highway cruising at 75. Love the handling, solidness, controls, comfort, power.

Fastest cars last year were Chevy Cruz....like to pass fast and zig zag into traffic. - This year it was Kia Souls, they don't look fast but their drivers drive them fast.

Hardest thing was taking the cut off from I-75 to the road leading to the bridge in Connecticut. By the time the GPS lady said to get in the right lane the right lane was completely packed. Had to slow down and wedge my way in front of a poor truck driver.

Out of round theory? No theory - truth! Tires are indeed screened for what is called ""uniformity"". That's a combination of roundness and stiffness. Vehicle manufacturers have specs for tire and wheel uniformity - individually and/or combined. Tires in the replacement market only have the tire manufacturer's specs - which are typically much higher than OEM specs.

OE tires? Tires are built to the vehicle manufacturer's specs - and every spec is such that it would NOT be what the tire manufacturer would do on his own - typically for fuel economy, which adversely affects tire wear and grip!.

In other words, if you do not like the tires that came on your new car (or truck!), blame the vehicle manufacturer. The tire manufacturer is merely supplying what the vehicle manufacturer wants."

That Distronic Plus sounds nice for a bit of a break from driving, but, I don't know if I could let myself use it much. I only used the cruise control for a short time when my foot needed a rest, but, most of the time traffic is too dense and unpredictable to use it very much.

I mentioned my friend with the R8 almost went through the windshield when a car cut in front and his auto braking system slammed on the brakes. He is now worried about the guy behind him not being able to stop as fast as he would have. He found it better to steer around the other car, rather than braking.

The Passat started right away and ran nice. Hard to back up a car without a rear camera though....you can get very used to all the latest technology.

They do both start with the same letter. One of those seniors moments...they come more frequently these days.

Saskatchewan is a difficult one.....there should be a law against using a name like that! Then there is a city in Saskatchewan called Saskatoon, all very confusing.

But even spelling those wrong I can understand, 57 states makes some sense,,,,since 57 is a major number esp for the Hienz company, but how does one get Connecticut and Cincinnati mixed up? I suppose each starts with a C, has about the same vowels and the same amount of vowels. Good thing we didn't go through Pittsburg, which we could have done, I would have got it mixed up with Philadelphia.

So the solution is don't alter the vehicles, and just pay the fine.
Something tells me it's not going to be quite that easy. Aside from the $billions in fines that will be levied, there will be compensation owed to the owners for misrepresentation (and yes, people do look at pollutants when deciding their car purchases) and their inconvenience...as well as the losses in value come trade or sale time.

I am finally starting to believe that this may indeed impact VW's viability, at least as they currently exist, given they've admitted that the problem affects practically their entire suite of brands.

I don't know if there is any truth to this. I do know that printer manufacturers (HP, Brother, etc) include a very small toner cartridge. Does maybe 1,000 pages, and then they sell you a new ""full size"" toner for more than you paid for the printer in the first place. The way around this is to make sure there are aftermarket suppliers for the toner BEFORE you invest in the printer.

Something tells me it's not going to be quite that easy. Aside from the $billions in fines that will be levied, there will be compensation owed to the owners for misrepresentation (and yes, people do look at pollutants when deciding their car purchases) and their inconvenience...as well as the losses in value come trade or sale time.

I am finally starting to believe that this may indeed impact VW's viability, at least as they currently exist, given they've admitted that the problem affects practically their entire suite of brands.
The only stroke of luck is the small number of units affected in the US, unless of course it spills over to the gas engines (first news just trickled in, so far just in Europe). Europe doesn't have litigeous culture, so the damage there is mostly in fines and  it will help them in dealings. If push comes to shove, they may simply nationalize them, as they have a track record of doing just that.

It may have changed but the starter packs in Brother printers could be extended to normal life with a couple of different reset tricks. I used some tape over the toner sensors on mine. It finally ran out last month and the toner cartridge was replaced by one from Meritline for $20.

It's Germany, not America. Many things are owned, wholly, or partially, by the governments in Europe. Nationalization is a common policy toward failing industries. Most of the time, it results in billions of taxpayer subsidies dished out for many years in efforts to appease militant unions. Once in a while it results in a successful reprivatization, most of the time only after writing off gazillions in bad debt, usually paid by the taxpayers. I prefer American system (up to 2009, that is) - you suck, you die.

It seems to me that the original equipment tires may be spec'ed as far as the tread rubber for mileage and quiet even though they appear to be the same tire as the aftermarket tires. I recall having replaced Firestones that came on my Buick with the same Firestones. Awful--replaced by dealer with Michelins that I should have bought to begin with. Weren't round. Couldn't be balanced to run round. I read notes after that to the effect that the OEM tires were pulled from the line and were the highest quality, in this case round, and the rest, the culls, were sent to the aftermarket buyers.

More recently my 03 came with Michelin Symmetry tires. But there were three different replacement Symmetry tires on Michelin's website. I believe Ford used them on a Town Car as well and that may have been one of the variations of Symmetry.

My Malibu came with Goodyear Eagle LS2 tires. So far, so good. But that's only 5000 miles. Can't find a reasonable Michelin in that size so far. I'm hoping Michelin adds that size to the Defender line. Otherwise I have to go to a premium tire with medium mileage ratings.

The Bridgestones that came on my Santa Fe were equally lousy, about 22-23K out of the first set. My F-150 with 32K on the OE Bridgestones seems to be the anomaly, at least for me. They still have a fair amount of tread left.

It's not even that those B's didn't last so long, they weren't so great even as new, just OK on dry, pretty lousy in on wet. Those OEM Co's on BMW were UHP, so they lasted about the same, 25k, but they were really sharp until worn. I have Bridgestones now on my BMW, obviously different model than the Subaru, all-season HP, they are quiet, nice, slightly less sharp than Co's, but the tradeoff is good, I just hope they'll last last a bit longer.

The A Service usually costs about $379.00 but when I bought my car, they included the first A Service (probably because they didn't think I'd ever use it).  So I will not be investing any money into the car.  Just turned 8200 miles in 11 months since I bought it.

I Googled ""2017 Mercedes E Class Sedan"" and several sites have some great pictures of it.  Looks like a small S Class Sedan or a big C Class Sedan.  The dash is totally different but they kept the GPS Screen in the upper center dash but it is recessed which means no iPad look to it.

There was some discrepancy as to expected release date - but it will be at the Detroit Auto Show in January.  They claim it might not be introduced until mid 2016.  I am in now hurry - very happy with my current vehicle.

The original Hankooks on my 2008 Cobalt wore really well. Round. And rolled round. Never had to have them rebalanced. But after 5 years, they were noisy due to hardening of the rubber. Michelins do that too, but not so early. Hankook dealer didn't want anything to do with the dry rot warranty--weren't none. Replaced with Michelins. Rubber aging may have been exacerbated because I didn't drive it much while my son was a freshman and sophomore; some say the tires need to be flexed to keep additives moving and active to prevent the tires from drying.

So, even though BBB said all terms were accepted, I still haven't seen what GM ""Thinks"" those terms are. That's why I can't understand BBB's purpose. I've only been dealing directly with Cadillac Corporate (and ultimately, GM) for the last several weeks. Until I see their letter, I really don't know for certain what the actual deal is. So yeah.....not smelling good, but I'll reserve judgement until I get their offer in writing and it's acceptable.

Snake....thanks for explaining what the accounting looks like on this. I suspect that once I give them the old CTS back, all warranties on it (at least warranties by Cadillac) are null and void. So, maybe there are no chargebacks on the losses (if any) incurred on the car? Not sure.

But, given that their agreement, like for like, regardless of purchase price, the delta is pretty big between the '14 and '16 CTS. I bought the '14 for around $43K plus a bit.

Looking at the '16, again same options, I come up with much more. In round numbers....

MSRP-$64K
Invoice-$60K
Holdback-($2K)
Current incentives-($2K)
Previous owner credit-($2K)

I come up with a value on the '16 CTS at $54K. That's a pretty big $10K+ delta between what I paid for the '14 and what the '16 would cost, at least on paper.

Finacially, I would think it would make more sense for them to just give me my money back that I paid for it, and take the '14 off my hands and sell it on the open market....maybe auction it. That's probably what they're going to do anyway. Are margins so big on the CTS that GM still makes money on this deal?

This is hitting closer to home, so I checked and the Passat has a 2.5 litre engine. The 1.4 l is in very small models;

Tuesday’s findings over carbon dioxide emissions, and petrol-fuelled cars, are understood to involve smaller 1.4-litre engines, mostly in the VW Polo and Golf, as well some Seat and Skoda cars, and the Audi A1 and A3.

A change in the CO2 emissions of the vehicles would also affect their fuel economy, VW admitted. ""It was established that the CO2 levels and thus the fuel consumption figures for some models were set too low during the CO2 certification process,"" the company said.

The company said it would “endeavour to clarify the further course of action as quickly as possible and ensure the correct CO2 classification for the vehicles affected” with the responsible authorities.

And, of course, the usuall blah blah blah,

“The board of management of Volkswagen deeply regrets this situation and wishes to underscore its determination to systematically continue along the present path of clarification and transparency,” it added.

Why don't they just say we got caught cheating our customers!

Unless a customer considered emissions in the purchase of their vehicle, I don't see the customer being cheated.

Andres, when you make statements like, ""...Unless a customer considered emissions in the purchase of their vehicle, I don't see the customer being cheated..."", do you ever look carefully or reread your statement before posting it?  Only someone who has only one way of looking at things or is short-sighted would make a comment like that!

Think about this for awhile:

I buy a Mercedes-Benz because of the luxury, handling, technology and comfort.  I then find out that my fuel economy is 25% worse than the EPA estimate because Mercedes-Benz purposely under-reported CO2 emissions by 30%.  Would I feel cheated even though I did not buy the Mercedes-Benz for reasons of fuel economy or emissions?  You're ""darn"" right I would feel I was cheated!

I buy a new refrigerator for more interior space for food and the convenience of a side-by-side format so I don't have to bend to see what's in the freezer.  I find out a month later that my electric bill is 18% higher than in previous months.  The only change in use is the new refrigerator.  I check the label and it has an energy saver rating of 87.  I call the manufacturer and find out the refrigerator I bought actually has a rating of 53, but the labels were misprinted.  Do I feel cheated even though I did not buy the appliance for the energy savings I would experience?  You're "" darn"" right I would feel cheated!

Are you starting to understand why your statement is thoughtless and short-sighted?

Sounds like they will have to adjust the software to get the CO2 levels down to where they alleged they
were in the earlier certification documents. That affects customers.

""A change in the CO2 emissions of the vehicles would also affect their fuel economy, VW admitted. ""It was established that the CO2 levels and thus the fuel consumption figures for some models were set too low during the CO2 certification process,"" the company said.

""The company said it would “endeavour to clarify the further course of action as quickly as possible and ensure the correct CO2 classification for the vehicles affected” with the responsible authorities.""



So the solution is don't alter the vehicles, and just pay the fine.

Another possible problem is that if the cars run legal all the time, the rest of the exhaust system may not be able to handle it.

The only examples I'm aware of were the GM EV1 electric car confiscation by the company, and some vehicles illegally imported into the US and later confiscated by the government. Pretty rare and different circumstances. There may be other examples but I don't recall any. I think a massive fine is the most likely scenario, which really won't do anything to correct the pollution.

If the true reason behind the regulations is to improve overall air quality, then I believe we have additional options to accomplish the same goal concerning the VW polluters. VW could compensate for the additional air pollution by building solar energy farms.

Guess I'm just burned up that I had to put a replacement set on my daughter's Optima yesterday at 21K, and that I had to spend $ on a leased car that will go back in 15K miles.

Fiat (or Bertone) X1/9....sister had one. At the time, pretty radical, but that wedge design could also be found on the British TRs, too (TR7/TR8?).

My sister had one. I remember driving it. Handled like nothing I've ever driven before, or since. Slow as a snail. Mid-engine with the motor right behind the cockpit. Made great sound, too.

But, as noted, extremely poor reliability. I think my sister only kept it a year and got so fed up with it after the warranty period (12 mos/12K mile), she traded it for a Saab.

Speaking of reliability, got this note from Cadillac yesterday....

Hi Daniel,

As I mentioned on the phone, I have received the case to repurchase your 2014 Cadillac CTS. In order to proceed, I will need the following documentation from you either by email (XXXXXXXXXXXX) or fax (XXXXXXXXXX). If faxing, please make sure your case number, XXXXXXXX, is listed on each fax page.

· Copy of Driver’s Licenses (for all on Title)

Once I have all the documents I need from you, I’ll be able to proceed with processing your case. My process can take about 7-10 business days depending how quickly I get the documents needed. After I’m able to process your case, I will send you a settlement offer to review, sign, and send back to me. The dealership involved will also receive a letter to review, sign and send back to me. Once I receive the last signed letter, I’ll be able to get a closing packet sent out to the dealership. The dealership should receive the closing packet about four days from when I get the last signed letter.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

So again, my understanding is they are buying my car back for exactly what I paid for it, including all fees, with no deductions for mileage or wear and tear. And, I agree to take that money and buy a new '16 CTS with the same MSRP, with no money out of pocket.

We'll see once they send this letter.

I don't know GG, unless I'm missing something this deal has a bad smell. Did this settlement guy specifically say they would put you in a new 16' for no extra cost? I wouldn't count on this guy standing by anything that was said by previous contacts.

I hope I'm wrong.

They should be able to make the two cars equal in value...with whatever incentives they need to use. Their portion will be probably get deducted as some kind of expense (maybe Snake will know), so they won't be out as much as it would seem.
GM Already expensed any cost they will incur with this trade back in 2014. There is a concept in accounting called the ""Matching Principle"" which states that any expenses associated with a product are expensed in the same accounting period that they receive the revenue. Hence expenses match related revenue and gives a proper picture of the profitability and financial health of the organization. The problem with this is that with products like cars where there will be warranty work done years after the initial sales it is hard to determine what those costs are. So companies like GM use past experiences to estimate what those costs are and expenses them in the year of sale. The expense of future warranty work creates a sort of prepaid warranty expense account which any payout for warranty work gets credited to.

How it will likely work out is that some accountant will work out the price of the new Caddy and the fair market value of the old caddy and any difference would be charged to the ""prepaid warranty expense"" account. However Cadillac would not be able to expense any costs involved seeing that it would have been included in their warranty estimate that was written off in the year of sale.

The dealership would likely get something from Cadillac which would be considered income for tax purposes.

I've been skiing since early childhood.  Over 20 broken bones, 8 or so surgeries, and more time on crutches than I can remember.  And not a single serious injury while skiing, thankfully.  I love skiing fresh snow glades hidden among the trees in particular.  My helmet and goggles do take some abuse and just last year I would have lost an eye if not for the protection.

No it wasn't a British vehicle. LOL. OnStar didn't answer with an accent either.

While other students in the parking lot at our fairly large high school had varied cars from new and old BMWs, a Corvette or two, lots of Nissan Q vehicles a few years old, many SUVs from Tahoes to Pilots, many used Hondas with and without the bad mufflers that plague that brand, many Chrysler products from Neons to midsizers, and a high, high percentage of pickup trucks both recent and aged models and while many vehicles had things on them to make the stand out, son was driving a Cobalt in black that looked brand new but was a 4-door instead of the sportier coupe. The only stylish thing about it was it had the RS ""driving"" lights a the bottom of the front.

During his junior year nobody hit the leSabre 1998 in the parking lot. After driving the Cobalt for band practices through the summer and into the fall, the Cobalt was lightly sideswiped on the plastic lower rear panel and the arch in front of the rear tire by an Explorer driven by a petite young lady who was part of the Guard group of the band parking making a wide sweeping turn. She didn't realize she brushed it with the right front rubber bumper cover. Son didn't notice it when he left. I saw it when parked at home. He recalled who was parked next to him that day. Called mother, whom we knew from band, at home. She looked at front bumper and asked the daughter about the scrape in the clearcoat on the bumper.

Don't buy an expensive car for high school parking lots (nor for tight apartment lots at private apartment buildings at urban universities like OSU). Go Bucks (and Bengals).

The talk about shoulder problems by several on here, Fezo for one, prompts me to talk about my wife's visit to the arm orthopedist Tuesday. Previous year had trouble with right shoulder and joint. This year it's the left. The gardening starting in April through the summer exacerbated it. Worried about rotator cup; same symptoms as right shoulder has and had last year. Pain was so bad we switched to earlier appointment Tuesday near Middletown to see doctor at a different location where he wasn't booked up with the 5-week wait. As her pain kept becoming unbearable I kept thinking about our friend Fezo and his shoulder problem.

His theory is that if it came on slowly, the treatment should be to relieve it slowly such as therapy and then injections, if needed. If it came on quickly, then MRI and quicker treatment, surgery, may be needed.

So again, my understanding is they are buying my car back for exactly what I paid for it, including all fees, with no deductions for mileage or wear and tear. And, I agree to take that money and buy a new '16 CTS with the same MSRP, with no money out of pocket.

We'll see once they send this letter.
It sounds promising. Probably the BBB told them there was no way they could stall any longer or the Attorney General would come after them. Read the documents carefully. We may not hear more as you may have to sign off that you won't disclose the settlement.

JW...I'm a little skeptical about that, too. In OH, if it's treated like a trade, like for like, with the same purchase price on both vehicles, with no money changing hands, the net tax result should be ZERO. We only pay taxes on the difference. That's one way they could do it.

Driver....not overjoyed about this whole thing to begin with. So, I'm viewing this with a very healthy dose of skepticism. We'll see how it plays out. They asked for a copy of my title, which shows the purchase price. I sent them a copy of the purchase agreement which shows the purchase price and all taxes. They showed a $250 doc fee, but they reduced it by the same amount on the other end, deducted from the purchase price amount. Curious about how they're going to account for the price differential between the incentives on the '14 vs the incentives on the '16. If on paper, they just show the purchase price as even, and then give the dealer a couple hundred for acting as the delivery vehicle, that's how it SHOULD work.

Again, hope to see this done in the next week or two.

They should be able to make the two cars equal in value...with whatever incentives they need to use. Their portion will be probably get deducted as some kind of expense (maybe Snake will know), so they won't be out as much as it would seem.

If this goes through it must break their heart.....they stalled, ignored, fought back every way possible and had to give in in the end.

I wonder if the dealer is one who takes photos of new car deliveries....if they take your picture make yourself look as angry as possible with a finger.

(When I worked for a division of Warner Brothers they bought 1000s of cars a year. They made their deal through GM head office, and the dealer would get about $150 for predelivery services. When I came in to pick up my car they pretty well through the keys at me and got me out of the showroom as fast as possible, not worth spending any time with me).

It began with opening remarks and then asking everyone to write positive messages on poster boards on the vandalized wall to show support for congregation - many of which natural born Americans just like us. All the faith leaders spoke and then all offered a closing prayer.

It was moving and every member of the center that was there took the time to shake hands with as many of us as possible. Then there was coffee, tea, and donuts and I discovered that all faiths love bonding over artery clogging pastries!!

On the wall were copies of e-mails offering support and assistance to clean up the graffiti from multiple business, social, scout, military, and religious groups from the area. It was impressive to see.

mavis tire was replacing the shocks and used a torch and set the rear seat on fire and the headliner. I have a cover over rear seat. Headliner is about $600 for a new one. Seat cover is about $500 or throw a blanket over it and youll never know. baby on the way and need a different vehicle. THE VEHICLE ITSELF IS MINT MINUS THE HOLE IN SEAT AND HEADLINER ISSUE

They (millennials) tend  not to worship or idolize or salivate over vehicles like the baby-boomers did/do.

Even my son, who is 44 years old, sees autos and SUV's as a means of getting from one place to another - nothing more.  That is why I believe car manufacturers like Hyundai, Kia, VW, Toyota, Nissan, Ford, GM's Chevy Division, etc., are successful because they appeal more to the millennials and their ""wants"" when it comes to basic transportation.  

Retired folks also tend to buy cars for basic transportation and at lower costs of ownership.  

These, of course, are generalizations extracted from reports of surveys compiled by car research companies like Maritz, JD Power, etc.

But there sure are enough of us still alive who shudder at the sight of a Corvette Stingray, Porsche, Mazzeratti, Mercedes-Benz, Rolls, Bentley, Ferrari, etc.  I sure don't buy cars for basic transportation - where's the fun in that?

2757,November 2015,PF_Flyer,"Taught both of my daughters to drive on manual transmission. I think it really helped them become better drivers because you HAVE to pay attention to what the vehicle is doing. Funny that both of them didn't like the engine getting to higher revs when they first started. They thought they were going too fast... in almost every lower gear. In PA, you have to have a parent keep a ride-a-long log for 50 hours noting things that they've learned/experienced. I thought that was really helpful as well, though I imagine that some parents just fill it out without really tracking what's going on.
I knew I was doing a good job fairly early in daughter #1's training when we were coming to a light that changed on her at the last minute, and she managed to do a semi-panic stop, downshifting along the way and stopped without any locking up of wheels (no ABS on the vehicle)
She was a bit rattled, but our next stop was the Dairy Queen as a reward for that STOP

I've trained 4 kids to drive. The two who were the most responsible have had multiple accidents. The two flakey ones none. I don't know what to make of that.

On the other hand...

I bought my daughter a 4 or 5 year old car when she was starting college. I figured I knew what to expect. A few weeks after she got it she ran into a curb. I had to buy a wheel and tire. A few months after that she came home with the right front fender bent. She took it on vacation to the shore and one of her friends smashed into the back of a pickup (no injuries, but I told her not to let anyone else drive it.)

When my son was starting college I bought him a new Nissan Sentra. I figured I knew what to expect. He drove it all through 5 years of college and never put a mark on it. We put tires on it once. He traded it in on his BMW after he graduated.

I guess if you know your kids buying them a new car when they are a new licensee doesn't make everyone a fool...to be kind.

I've still got a while until my oldest is ready to learn to drive.  He just turned 9 in September. Time does fly by when you are having fun.  I like @roadburner's idea of having the kid drive something not so sporty for a year along with some BMWCCA street survival courses for 12 full months.  I think the Legacy would fit the bill if I can hold on to it that long.  I think a BRZ/FRS would be a cool 1st car.  Maybe I could lease it for 3 years, drive it myself, then pass it off to the kid.  Problem is, what do I do for son #2 who is 2 1/2 years younger, the my daughter who is about 2 years & 8 months younger than son #2.

2767,November 2015,stickguy,"My kids are 4.5 years (5 grades) apart, so never had to worry about car overlap. By the time #2 could drive, #1 had his HS car (the old TL) with him at college. We got lucky with that one. Great car, but old and well worn body. Perfect, until the senior year when it had some issues.

Daughter did fine for 3 years with the Volvo. Only issue year was how long a drive it was to school, otherwise would probably still have it.

new vs. used is not that big a deal IMO, if you are getting something recent. can be a cost difference of course, but you can get that with different new cars. So basically it is not a new vs. used issue, it is nice vs. beater!

I recommend something solid and sound but not necessarily pretty for HS/new driver duty (HSs are notoriously bad for parking lots!). Once you get through that phase, the kids should have a more established track record, and the best option IMO is based on your family financials, how trustrworthy the kid is, the college (distance and parking situation) etc. Like for my son. 4 hour drive, but he lived in a dump for 3 years, with a lousy driveway and terrible parking spot. Not a chance in the world I was paying for a nice car to go there.

my daughter though parks in a nice lot. basically like an apartment building, so not too worried about the parking situation for a newer car.

That bell was originally at the house we lived in until we moved to the farm in 1974.

When I was a kid I liked to ring the bell and watch the cars on the main drag pull over. Drove my mom nuts; Dad thought it was funny...

This is hitting closer to home, so I checked and the Passat has a 2.5 litre engine. The 1.4 l is in very small models;

Tuesday’s findings over carbon dioxide emissions, and petrol-fuelled cars, are understood to involve smaller 1.4-litre engines, mostly in the VW Polo and Golf, as well some Seat and Skoda cars, and the Audi A1 and A3.

A change in the CO2 emissions of the vehicles would also affect their fuel economy, VW admitted. ""It was established that the CO2 levels and thus the fuel consumption figures for some models were set too low during the CO2 certification process,"" the company said.

The company said it would “endeavour to clarify the further course of action as quickly as possible and ensure the correct CO2 classification for the vehicles affected” with the responsible authorities.

And, of course, the usuall blah blah blah,

“The board of management of Volkswagen deeply regrets this situation and wishes to underscore its determination to systematically continue along the present path of clarification and transparency,” it added.

After 6 months of the constant fighting for the car, I sold it for $1000 less than I paid for it and then there was nothing left to fight about (that is pertaining to who gets to use the car) - the kids were very close in age which was a primary reason for their disagreements.

That was at the end of an era, a bad era. The late 70's into the very early 80's was a bad time for high performance cars. Pollution controls and insurance rates neutered high performance cars. In the mid 80's I was driving around in a Dodge Omni GLH that would smoke Mustangs, Cameros and even Vettes from the late 70's (it had around 145 HP IIRC and was light).
I remember the GLH, it really did ""Goes Like Hell""! And yes, that was what the acronym stood for, truly. The only problem was that I couldn't fit in one.

Mike - thanks for the story. I'll share mine - some of you have heard this from me before.

When my stepson turned 16 we got him a nice used car. The wife and I found a used Geo Tracker 4-door for sale by a retired GM executive. 60,000 miles, perfect condition. Our stepson had mostly driven our 2002 Explorer when he had his permit, so we figured he was comfortable with the dynamics of driving an SUV.

Wrong.

Just a month after getting his license, he decided to take a friend home from school. The route he took meant that he had to drive a dirt road to return to our house. A combination of speed and lack of experience led to a major accident. No serious injuries, though his sister was flown to the hospital via helicopter to address a moderate concussion. The Tracker was totaled.

I think I've mentioned this before, but we sent our son to the two day teen school at the BMW Performance Center in South Carolina. After that I let him drive my 1975 2002 and my wife and I told him that if he kept his grades up and had no accidents or tickets we'd discuss an upgrade in 12 months. We also had him attend Street Survival(driving the '02) when it was held in Louisville. One year later he had kept up his end of the deal and he surprised us both by asking for his mom's nine year old X3. He said if he had something fast he'd get into trouble. He's still driving it four years later with no at fault accidents or tickets.

Funny thing about my son's high school parking lot; a few of his classmates got new Mustangs or Miatas, but his 1975 2002 attracted more attention, since it bore a slight resemblance to the Baur Cabriolet in the Katy Perry ""Teenage Dream"" video that was released around the same time...

Both kids were within 18 months of each others age.  My daughter used to borrow my wife's car as needed.  When Justin had his 16th birthday and got his driver's license, I decided to buy the kids a car they had to share - I could not afford to buy 2 cars with the two we already had because I could not afford the expense of a 4th car and the insurance.  Biggest mistake I ever made!!!

All the new car did was give my kids another major thing to fight about.  It was almost constant -

That situation sounds very familiar. I have two younger sisters that are 17 months apart, and I am the oldest by 4 years. When I was in college my two sisters were in high school and dad had an older Toyota Corona Mk II and a Pontiac Grand Am that the girls drove. Though they were not ""their"" cars, one sister typically drove the Toyota and the other the Grand Am. When my little sister wrecked the Toyota, it was totaled, dad did not replace it. So the girls fought over the Gran Am. Dad quickly reminded them it was ""his""car and if they couldn't play nice, the car was no longer available to them. That got their attention!

I wonder if it's the parents that wanted to show off or if that's the kid's real value system. Would he have been happy with a 4-year old vehicle that wasn't of a premium name tag?
If the parents offer the new car I am sure the kid will take it. Just me, but, I think that is wrong on so many levels.......even if I had $50million, I wouldn't give a 16 year old a brand new luxury vehicle. If they needed a car at all, it would be a vanilla Camry type car.....as safe as possible, but, pretty tame.

That was at the end of an era, a bad era. The late 70's into the very early 80's was a bad time for high performance cars. Pollution controls and insurance rates neutered high performance cars. In the mid 80's I was driving around in a Dodge Omni GLH that would smoke Mustangs, Cameros and even Vettes from the late 70's (it had around 145 HP IIRC and was light).

IMHO, average customers become background noise. I make sure that I don't become an average customer. I ask when I pick up the car ""do you think I'll get a survey? I know those are important to you and I'll take car of you."" I use their names and make sure they know mine.

Judge Judy often is wrong in her interpretation of evidence, especially of a scientific nature, but she is right about boys not being ""cooked"" as far as sound decision making until they're 24 or some age like that. The bragging about a new car at the day of getting a license is really bad for the kid's understanding of life. My son drove an 11-year old leSabre to the school for the first year. Other kids could hit it all they wanted. Then we picked up a car for him for his senior year, but it was a pedantic vehicle, not high-powered show off car.

I wonder if it's the parents that wanted to show off or if that's the kid's real value system. Would he have been happy with a 4-year old vehicle that wasn't of a premium name tag?

I taught driving to high school students at one time in my illustrious career. I took a special course so I could teach in car and in the classroom.

The instructors who taught me, said people of average intelligence make the best drivers. They pay more attention to what they are doing. Super intelligent people think driving is kind of mundane, and their minds are thinking about other things.....how to split atoms, finding a cure for cancer, find new sources of energy etc.

I don't know if that is true but it sounds as good an explanation as any.

I.ve had 2 accidents in 52 years of driving, both caused by the other driver (one went through a stop sign, one pulled out from a parallel parking spot), so, I don't know if I like that explanation!

Question for the baseball experts.

Has any team ever lost three in a row and been able to win the Worlds Series?
Yes, the Twins did it in 1987 and in 1991 and the diamondbacks did it in 2001. In all three cases the winning team had home field advantage and won the first two games at home then lost three in a row away then won the last two at home.

Now if you are asking if any team has ever won after losing the first three games then no. The only team in North America sports to win a seven game series after losing the first three were the 2004 Red Socks in the AL championship.

Yes that was the first one that Shelby messed with, had a turbo 2.2 liter (IIRC the non turbo 2.2 produced 95+/-hp) GLH was said to mean ""Goes Like Hell"" and it did. When they discontinued the GLH Shelby got a hold of the last few hundred and souped those up to the GLH-S which produced around 175hp, for a 2200 pound car that was a lot in the 80's.

The inventory levels are really low on the 2015's though so I had to wait all day to find out what color I was getting. The dealer had offered to find me a light interior and anything but silver or black. Another local dealer had gray with gray but the two of them don't trade with each other. I got the call at 7 PM last night that they didn't have any luck and I could take what they had in stock so silver over black it is.

This is the dealer I've worked with for over 10 years now. I know I can walk into service and the manager knows my name, gives me preferential treatment, and discounts. They've been in the same location for 42 years with the same owner. They sell as many cars as the self proclaimed ""biggest VW dealer (building) in the world.""

Well, I was only there for about 15 minutes and my car got towed away....I had to pick it up miles away, and it cost $200 to get it back which was a lot of money at the time.

The deer plague has made it impossible to grow field crops any more. 100% loses are typical. The population has outstripped habitat and desperate deer are ravaging farms and suburbs. Unfortunately hunters have been demonized by well meaning animal lovers who illegally feed them for half the winter and then jet off to Florida leaving starving deer to destroy their neighbor's shrubbery. Lyme disease is epidemic as well.

I invite any and all hunters to set up on my property. Unfortunately my area of the county has banned anything but bow hunting (except for a small section owned by a connected politician ) so every year we see more of them jumping in front of vehicles.


Maybe I should quit the farm and buy a body shop.

Just received a call from the pharmacy that distributes specialized drugs (Walgreen's, CVS, Publix, Walmart, , etc., do not carry nor can they get those drugs from pharmaceutical companies) that my insurance company has approved the prescriptions for Veikira Pak and Ribavirin. Just waiting to hear if the Foundation will be picking up my copay ($12,000+). If not, I will have to pay it off some how. Merck Pharmaceuticals is coming out with yet another Hep C anti viral medication in early 2016.

The major difference of this drug over Harvoni (which did not kill off the virus completely after 1 month after stopping the drug) is that Veikira Pak does not kill the virus but rather stops it from reproducing which eventually stops the virus from attacking my liver.and eliminates the virus through attrition. The Ribavirin is just an antiviral drug, but when I took it with interferon back in 2006, the side effects were murder. I used to feel faint at times and it kept me from sleeping at night (which Harvoni also did).

I have to take 3 pills in the monring, with food, and 3 pills in the afternoon with food. Also, the treatment is for 24 weeks, not 12 like the Harvoini. The reason they cannot give me the Harvoni again for 24 weeks is because the virus I have will have developed some resistance to the drug because I've taken it.

I just hope I can handle the side-effects. If after a month or so I can no longer tolerate the side effects, I will have to come off the drug and wait for another Hep C drug to come onto the market. The research and number of treatments available over the last 12 months is geometrically increasing. I just hope this works. I will have to take blood tests every 4 weeks like before in order to find out if the viral load (count) is decreasing or being eliminated. Right now it is 151,000 (it was 354,000 before I started taking Harvoni). I can't tell you how depressing it is to find out after ""0"" viral load test results for 4 months the final blood test showed fast increases in the virus count.

Good grief, will the stressers in my life ever ease off or am I going to have to live with this constant stress for the rest of my life, however long that is going to be.
I am hopeful that everything works out with minimal issues for you, we are all pulling for you.

I received a call from a nurse who works for AbbVie Pharmaceuticals - the manufacturer of Viekira Pak, which is the new drug I am on.  The pharmacy that delivered my pills had notified me of their support services for patients.

She was very attentive and knowledgable. She took my history along with the other prescription drugs I take.  She advised me about blood tests after 2 weeks, 4 weeks and every 4 weeks after that.  I have to be careful of my platelet counts, CBC's due to anemia being a side effect of the Ribavirin I am taking in conjunction with Viekira Pak.

Most of the side effects I am experiencing are expected - insomnia, headache, muscle pains and aches, weakness and tiredness.  This nurse will be in contact with me periodically and I have her phone number if I need to contact her.

One of the reasons the drug companies that produce these new Hep C products have direct assistance for patients is because these new drugs were approved by the FDA on ""fast-tracking"" approval.  Even though the drug is approved, I am still considered as part of the long-term trial.  The drug companies agreed to provide these services as a means of collecting additional data for the FDA.

I usually drive up to Boca Raton every morning on the Florida Turnpike - fastest way up there - 15 minute drive to the mall from my Condo.

Coming back this morning, I exited at my usual exit and instead of going through the ""SunPass"" lane, which is in the far left lane, I usually stay in the far right lane because I have to make a fairly quick right turn after the toll booth. This old guy in a very old Lexus ES300, is driving through and ""throws"" his money at the toll booth collector (the far northern Broward County Exits still have some toll booths for those who want to pay cash). The Toll Booth Collector comes out of her enclosure and stands right at this guys left front door and told him to get out of his car and pick up the pennies, nickels and dimes he threw at her. He opens his door and gets out of his car with his ""cane"" and begins to pick up the coins. He was short some money and had to go into his wallet to give her a $1.00 bill. He gets back into his car and waits for his change.

I am sitting right behind this guy and heard the scolding he took from the toll collector. The toll collector takes the change, walks up to the left front door of this guy's car and ""throws"" the change right at his lap and tells him to get the heck (I cleaned this up a bit) out of here.

Now, there are only two reasons this guy would throw money at the toll collector:

1. He can't see very well or had dementia and thought it was an ""exact"" change booth
2. He had some beef with the Turnpike authority or with toll collectors.

I don't know if I would have made him pick up his pennies and nickels and dimes after seeing he needed a cane, but I sure would have scolded him and probably had thrown the change right back at him!

Ah, Southeast Coast of Florida - God's Waiting Room.
The bad thing about tollways is that it seems to be a large impersonal organization. Sometimes with the head office hours away. For the vast majority of ""customers"" the toll collector is the only employee that they will see and sometimes the customer takes out frustrations on the toll collector.

However that is no excuse for the toll collectors actions. FWIW many authorities do not allow the collector to pick up monies from the ground.

My dad bought a 1966 Lincoln Continental 4-door with the suicide doors.  He often remarked that he made a big mistake going from Cadillac to Lincoln.  The Lincoln was just a floating ""boat"" - handling was loose-goosie and very underpowered.  Too much plastic on the dash and front panel.  He replaced that car with a 1967 Cadillac and never owned another Ford product again.

The Cadillac handled better, interior was richer and softer, and the ride was smooth but you could feel the road.  I drove the cars and I agreed.

I owned a 1988 Brown Lincoln Town Car with brown cloth roof and brown leather interior and it was like riding on a flying carpet.  The car was not a good city vehicle but on the road, it was smooth as silk.  That car was also underpowered.

I got a call from my doctor at 9:00 AM this morning with some bad news.  The blood test I took last week showed that the Hepatitis C is again spreading in my blood and liver.  I was shocked and became very depressed.  After 12 weeks on the drug it showed no viral count but one month later after I stopped taking the drug (Harvoni) it is back as strong as before.

There is another drug regimen that includes a drug I took in 2005 that gave me terrible side effects - Ribarivin I think it's called - which has to be taken with another drug.  I would feel faint when taking my shower and it was difficult to drive do my Dad drove me when needed.  I don't have Dad any longer so I am in a dilemma.

I think the cost of the drugs are very expensive and my insurance may not approve any more treatments.  So I may just have to live with this disease.  It eventually causes sorosis and in its final stages - liver cancer.

Needless to say I am not handling this very well.  I will have to see what the doctor and the insurance company have in store for me.

All I can ask from you guys is to pray for me.  
Mike, I've been off the board for a while but you are in our prayers. Don't give up, there's got to be a drug out there that shows promise or at least provide some relief. Peruse Google-Scholar to see what the literature says about new to approaches to treating Hep-C."
2881,November 2015,abacomike,"
Thanks, BWIA, for the suggestion.  I am online all the time.  Right now, the only regimen prescribed for two-time ""losers"" (failed irradiation of HEP C twice) is Veikira Pak + Ribavirin, which is what I am on.  There are new drugs coming out in early 2016.  The major difference between this drug and others is that it targets viral replication of the virus.  In other words, instead of trying to kill the virus directly, it targets its ability to reproduce.  Eventually, through attrition, the virus eventually dies.

They couldn't give me anything similar to Harvoni (which I just finished after 12 weeks - virus came back) because the virus has built up a tolerance for those types of drugs.

Merck has a new pharmaceutical coming out in a few months so if this doesn't work, perhaps they will put me on that one.

It's just the side effects of these drugs that are affecting my life right now.  My viral loads are very low to moderate compared to 90% of the Hep C population.  Mine was 351,000 before Harvoni and 4 weeks after treatment, it's 152,000.  The average viral load for baby-boomers is 2-4 million.  Baby boomers are the ones mostly affected because the virus was unknown until 1988-90 which is when they started screening blood banks for the Hep C virus.

Thankfully, my liver enzymes are elevated, but the virus has not yet caused sorosis or tumors or cancer.  The end result of Hep C viral infection is liver cancer.

I follow a Hep C support group online where I share and learn how others who are in my exact predicament handle side effects and take the same medications after two other attempts to kill the virus.  The more attempts made to unsuccessfully destroy the virus, the less effective subsequent treatments are with other drugs.  That's also why I have to be on this regimen for 24 weeks.

After 2-3 weeks, I will have blood tests done to check liver function, viral loads, blood counts, heart, etc., because of the heavier side effects of this new regimen.

2882,November 2015,carnaught,"Mike, Harvoni doesn't kill the virus, per se, rather it's two anti-virals target different pathways of viral replication.

Sorry you're experiencing such severe side-effects. Hopefully this regimen, however, will do it's job and prevent any sequellae. So, your's isn't the genotype 1 strain, I guess?"
2883,November 2015,abacomike,"
I do - genotype 1a.  What I'm taking now works on type 1a and 1b.  Unfortunately, the Harvoni worked, but only while I was taking it.  They should have kept me on it for 24 weeks, but they did not know how resistant my virus was.  8 weeks on Hsrvoni is standard, but because I had a previous treatment 10 years ago, they extended it to 12 weeks.

I just hope this drug gets it.  It's not just physical side effects the worry about - it's hemoglobin count, liver damage, etc., that is the worst.  That's why my blood tests will be more frequent than every 4 weeks at first.

The stagecoach turned into a pumpkin at the stroke of midnight for the Cinderella Mets. I've been a Mets fan for 10 years and have suffered through some of the worst teams in memory, so this year was more than a surprise, it was totally shocking. They rode some outstanding starting pitching to get to the Series, but their hitting was very streaky all year and their team defense was never very good this year. Hopefully for next year they can find a second baseman who can field and hit a little bit, and improve their consistency at the plate.

2888,November 2015,abacomike,"I drove up to the Boca Town Center Mall this morning and took my walk. I was able to complete the entire circumferences of the mall but before walking to my car, I had to sit for about 15 minutes to regain some strength. If I can do that every morning, I'd be very happy - exercise is extremely important.

What I immediately noticed at the mall is that they had obviously spent the night getting the mall decorated for Christmas! Talk about rushing the season/holidays. Most of the mall stores do not have holiday decorations up, but the Take A Picture With Santa kiosk (huge) was in place and so were the electric train rides around Santa's Village. Doesn't Thanksgiving come before Christmas? Not one decoration for Thanksgiving.

The one store that is always the last to decorate for Christmas is Nordstrom's. They even put up a sign in their windows stating that they do not decorate for Christmas until after Thanksgiving. I always admired their policy to ""not rush the season"".

2891,November 2015,abacomike,"I usually drive up to Boca Raton every morning on the Florida Turnpike - fastest way up there - 15 minute drive to the mall from my Condo.

Coming back this morning, I exited at my usual exit and instead of going through the ""SunPass"" lane, which is in the far left lane, I usually stay in the far right lane because I have to make a fairly quick right turn after the toll booth. This old guy in a very old Lexus ES300, is driving through and ""throws"" his money at the toll booth collector (the far northern Broward County Exits still have some toll booths for those who want to pay cash). The Toll Booth Collector comes out of her enclosure and stands right at this guys left front door and told him to get out of his car and pick up the pennies, nickels and dimes he threw at her. He opens his door and gets out of his car with his ""cane"" and begins to pick up the coins. He was short some money and had to go into his wallet to give her a $1.00 bill. He gets back into his car and waits for his change.

I am sitting right behind this guy and heard the scolding he took from the toll collector. The toll collector takes the change, walks up to the left front door of this guy's car and ""throws"" the change right at his lap and tells him to get the heck (I cleaned this up a bit) out of here.

Now, there are only two reasons this guy would throw money at the toll collector:

1. He can't see very well or had dementia and thought it was an ""exact"" change booth
2. He had some beef with the Turnpike authority or with toll collectors.

I don't know if I would have made him pick up his pennies and nickels and dimes after seeing he needed a cane, but I sure would have scolded him and probably had thrown the change right back at him!

2893,November 2015,Michaell,"Had an experience last night whilst delivering I wanted to share.

The town I live in is divided in two by I-25 .. depending on the address, I'll take the highway for an exit or two to avoid traffic signals.

Last night around 5:30 I was going up the offramp and found a car stopped in the left lane (it's a two lane exit). I slowed down and noticed that the car was smashed in on the grille and the engine was still steaming, so I pulled over to check on the driver.

Turns out a deer had jumped in front of her car and completely caved in the front grille and passenger headlight assembly. Her airbag had gone off and the car was leaking fluid. The deer was on the side of the road, dead. Apparently this happened just seconds before I came on the scene. I asked her if she was OK - she was shaking her left wrist, which she said was hurt from the airbag. She called 911, but was too upset to talk coherently to the operator, so I took the phone from her and told her where we were and what happened.

Turns out the driver was not from our town and was on her way to pick up her daughter from a friends house. The car - a Pontiac Torrent - was not going anywhere under its own power, given the amount of damage. I waited until the emergency services arrived, gave the police officer my name and number, then left to complete my delivery.

The deer was not that large - probably an adolescent - but I suspect the driver was still doing 50-55 MPH when the impact occurred.

When I lived in Pennsylvania, I had two close calls with deer while driving.  One was on I-80 near Hazelton - I was doing 60 mph because there was a dusting of snow.  An entire deer family - Buck, Doe and Fawn crossed I-80 in front of me about 60 yards up the road.  Luckily they crossed quickly because I would have skidded on the snow if I had to stop quickly.

The second interaction was with a fawn.  I was making a right turn on a back road and out of nowhere came this fawn and I hit the poor thing, but not hard enough to cause damage to the car.  I was able to stop quickly.  The fawn got up and literally flew away down the road.  Did not see the doe or buck - but I was very happy I did not kill the fawn.

Another bad side effect is possible anemia which they do frequent blood tests for.

I can only recall having seen 1 of that style Lincoln in my years of car cruise-ins and shows. It was medium blue and it was in a small town near here. I wonder if a lot of those are in museums or just kept in storage by owners. There can't be many of those that were sold. Someone probably knows how to look up that data.

I have been with this company for a decade. Up until this year, I had a daughter on my policy, now 23, but she left this year. So I was expecting a nice rate decrease, which did not happen.

I decided to take a look at rates from some other companies. I settled on a new policy with The Hartford for about $1,400 a year. A nice savings and the coverage was better, lower deductible.

I called GEICO to cancel the upcoming $2,100 policy. I was immediately turned over to a GEICO expert for my state. After a short period, the ""expert"" came back with a policy comparable to The Hartford at about $990 a year.

My dad bought a 1966 Lincoln Continental 4-door with the suicide doors.  He often remarked that he made a big mistake going from Cadillac to Lincoln.  The Lincoln was just a floating ""boat"" - handling was loose-goosie and very underpowered.  Too much plastic on the dash and front panel.  He replaced that car with a 1967 Cadillac and never owned another Ford product again.

The Cadillac handled better, interior was richer and softer, and the ride was smooth but you could feel the road.  I drove the cars and I agreed.

I owned a 1988 Brown Lincoln Town Car with brown cloth roof and brown leather interior and it was like riding on a flying carpet.  The car was not a good city vehicle but on the road, it was smooth as silk.  That car was also underpowered.

That was true of all Fords of that era - 60s. I drove taxi cabs and taught driving at that time and I preferred Chryslers for handling , GMs were a close second, and Fords lacked any feel for steering and handling. The |Chryslers seemed more nimble, but were the least reliable. Most of the late 60s Fords had to be started by holding the gear shift up in the air a bit with your left hand, while you turned the key with your right hand. I was told it was a Ford thing. The shifter was a bit loose and you had to do that to make contact.

I remember a review of the 1969 Large Ford and it said the Ford Galaxy felt clumsy and dumb. I thought that explained it really well.

The major difference of this drug over Harvoni (which did not kill off the virus completely after 1 month after stopping the drug) is that Veikira Pak does not kill the virus but rather stops it from reproducing which eventually stops the virus from attacking my liver.and eliminates the virus through attrition. The Ribavirin is just an antiviral drug, but when I took it with interferon back in 2006, the side effects were murder. I used to feel faint at times and it kept me from sleeping at night (which Harvoni also did).

I have to take 3 pills in the monring, with food, and 3 pills in the afternoon with food. Also, the treatment is for 24 weeks, not 12 like the Harvoini. The reason they cannot give me the Harvoni again for 24 weeks is because the virus I have will have developed some resistance to the drug because I've taken it.

I just hope I can handle the side-effects. If after a month or so I can no longer tolerate the side effects, I will have to come off the drug and wait for another Hep C drug to come onto the market. The research and number of treatments available over the last 12 months is geometrically increasing. I just hope this works. I will have to take blood tests every 4 weeks like before in order to find out if the viral load (count) is decreasing or being eliminated. Right now it is 151,000 (it was 354,000 before I started taking Harvoni). I can't tell you how depressing it is to find out after ""0"" viral load test results for 4 months the final blood test showed fast increases in the virus count.

Good grief, will the stressers in my life ever ease off or am I going to have to live with this constant stress for the rest of my life, however long that is going to be.

The modified Mustang GT will come in three editions with small production numbers – 243 King models, 43 King Premier and 14 King Premier convertibles. Customers can order the cars through their local Ford dealership.

Starting with a factory Ford Mustang GT, Petty's Garage adds a Ford Performance supercharger to the stock 5.0-liter V8 engine. The supercharger adds 235 horsepower, for a total output of 670 horsepower, backed by a three-year, 36,000-mile powertrain limited warranty. Other powertrain modifications include custom engine calibration, a cold-air intake for better breathing and a MagnaFlow exhaust.

Backing up that power are extreme-duty TrakPak Ford Performance halfshafts, three-way adjustable front and rear sway bars, and a rear axle upgrade.

Custom matte-black Petty's Garage/HRE staggered 20- x 9-inch front wheels and 20- x 10-inch rear wheels with Continental Extreme Performance summer tires are standard.

In addition to the go-fast pieces, the cars are worked over with a number of Petty's Garage appearance parts – including custom rear diffuser with Richard Petty-designed center-mounted exhaust, shift knob, sill plates, floor mats, embroidered head restraints and rear spoiler. The King signs every model on a special dash plate.

The King Premier edition features different HRE/Petty's Garage wheels, a big brake upgrade kit that includes six-piston front brakes and four-piston rears over two-piece rotors, and custom leather trimmed interior. Other highlights include a complete Petty's Garage/BASF custom tri-color stripe package featuring iconic Petty blue, red and white stripes covered in crushed and tumbled glass in clear coat. Petty blue body cladding gets the clear coat crushed and tumbled glass as well.

Options for all three editions include different wheel bushings to minimize wheel hop, a coil-over racing suspension and a supercharger upgrade that results in a total of 727 horsepower.

Starting suggested retail prices are $67,495 for the King edition and $90,495 for King Premier. More details and available options can be found at the Petty's Garage website.

IMHO the best way to see most cities is a Hop On Hop Off bus, they give you facts and you will get an overview of the city. I stops at any hilites you may be interested in seeing.

Some countries though, a tour is the only way to do it, St Petersburg Russia for one - you can't do it on your own unless you get a visa. Egypt because there is no way you want to venture around on your own. China is another, you wouldn't have a clue how to manage on your own.

fezo...good news on the shoulder. Sorry to hear about your Miata. What year is it, again? The good news there, parts SHOULD BE available. Be well!

Driver....wife and I had a ""spirited"" conversation about the China visit. I agree with you....week to 10 days would be perfect. I couldn't do much more than that for a variety of reasons that are mostly work related. The other reasons, she will be gone over the holidays, leaving the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and not returning until after Christmas. Her attachment to this trip and the country overall is strong. I prefer to spend the Holidays at home with family.

Given she's a teacher, and has been for a couple of decades, she has a lot of vacation time saved up (nearly two years worth). So, as long as she gives the district enough notice (which she apparently did some time ago). She can take that sort of time off. Fact is, given she's been a teacher for 25+ years, she will get full retirement benefits when she's ready to take them. Teachers are on a whole different set up than the majority of us when it comes to retirement and time off.

China's not a cheap trip by any stretch, either. C'est la vie!

So, I haven't taken any vacation yet this year. And, I use it or lose it. I get 4 weeks, but as most of us know, trying to take that much time off in the business community is very hard to do. So, one week it is.

Asked my son if he wanted to go. But, he was just hired by a start up, who's offering a very nice compensation package, including pre-IPO stock options. So, he really can't go either.

That's how I happened onto the cruise in a solo cabin. I'm going alone, but won't be alone. It will be warm (Bahamas) at a time when it will be at least ""chilly"" in the OH Valley. Will come back the week before Christmas, and be ready for the Holidays.
Why not take your week off and surprise her by showing up unannounced? Bet that would mean more to her than if you stayed the whole month.

2967,October 2015,karhill1,"Ah auto insurance.

I had and have insurance with GEICO. A couple of months ago, I received notice of my premium for two vehicles, BMW and Acura both new, of about $2,100 a year. I have been with this company for a decade. Up until this year, I had a daughter on my policy, now 23, but she left this year. So I was expecting a nice rate decrease, which did not happen.

I decided to take a look at rates from some other companies. I settled on a new policy with The Hartford for about $1,400 a year. A nice savings and the coverage was better, lower deductible.

I called GEICO to cancel the upcoming $2,100 policy. I was immediately turned over to a GEICO expert for my state. After a short period, the ""expert"" came back with a policy comparable to The Hartford at about $990 a year.

I had a similar experience with COMCAST. In June my monthly rate jumped $150. Of course I called COMCAST and was told my ""special offer"" period had ended. I was, of course, immediately offered a new rate which was less than my previous rate but had more premium channels.

One of my favorite gripes is XM radio and their ""you need to call us to cancel"" policy. They always tried to charge me full price until I call and tell them I wanted to cancel. Then they offer a six month plan for $25. But they always say I need to call to cancel or they will continue after six months for the full price. This time, I simply cancelled. I do not want to have to call them every six months.

Fezo, I just read an article about this orthopedic surgeon who uses a brand new technique for rotator cuff repairs.  He has an office in Boca Raton, FL and does his surgery at Boca West Medicsl Center.  

He places tissue from a pig (IIRC) surrounding the entire rotator cuff.  After several months, the tissues and muscles had no distinguishing remnants of the pig's tissues.  The body takes over the healing and it acts like fetal tissue in repairing the muscle.

Ask your surgeon if he's heard of that.  There are very few surgeons certified to use this process and the results are extraordinary.

Driver, perhaps it's because we are soooooo....OLD!  In 1963, I was a sophomore at NYU.  BTW, I looked up the 1955-1968 Mercury line and that reverse slanting rear window that retracted was first introduced in 1963.  Our neighbors had just bought a 1963 Monterey 4-door and I remember the guy bragging to my dad about the reverse angle rear window and showed us the button he pressed to drop it.  I also remember my dad showing his 1963 Cadillac Sedan DeVille to the guy as we got into the new Caddie (that's what everyone called Cadillacs back in our day) and drove off to pick up my mom for dinner.

These posts sure bring a tear to my eye remembering my mom and dad - miss them terribly.

I also remember the day my dad bought his 1967 Coupe DeVille convertible.  White leather interior and a pastel turquoise body and white cloth roof.  He waited 7 weeks for that car.  My mom took our dog to the vet the very next day and rear-ended a truck on the Long Island Expressway which was backing up in the right lane because he missed his exit.  That was the end of my dad's pride and job.  At least he got to drive it a couple of hours.  Honest - no BS - true story!!!

Inertia, and it works.

There are so many instances where this applies. I was with DirecTV for many years, and now I'm with Dish. When my 2 year contract with Dish is up, I will probably go back to DirecTV to get their ""great introductory rate"", which Dish will refuse to match.

I have 3 accounts with SiriusXM, so 3 times a year I have to call on the phone and negotiate. Which is a pain, but it saves me right at $100 per year per account.

I did have two internet service providers, up until a few minutes ago. Comcast as my primary, and AT&T Uverse as the backup. I have to call every year, and re-negotiate to get the Uverse bill cut in half. But this time, just now, they refused, so I canceled. I'll bet money within one or two months I will get a new introductory rate offer.

So far, Comcast has been quite good about renegotiating every year, I hope that continues. This last time, I had to add their basic TV service in order to get the best rates. Very weird, I don't want it, and don't use, but adding it to my account saves me $20 per month.

Recently, I had a round with electric service rates. I started to say providers, but there is only one actual provider (the company that generates the electricity and runs wires to my house). I had my service switched back and forth (on paper, or ""in the billing computer somewhere""), about 3 times, with the rate going down each time I got a phone call offering to top the offer from the other party.

Very strange world we're living in. I guess there are enough people out there who won't negotiate that these strategies pay off for the big companies.

Stopped at a far and got things like real eggs from unstacked, uncooped chicken and other such things. My day has just gone from that part and on Rt. 24 traffic suddenly stops dead.

This is likely to turn into an argument as to whether it's totaled but I intend to fight it out.

With my daughter's car I ended up making a little money. I don't expect to do more than break even here and the car will be laid up for the winter by the time it's fixed. If it were really totaled which I don't think it it is wouldn't be the end of the world. I'd have rented it for the summer for $1,000 or so and gotten that bug taken care of. We'll see.

Well the first use on a production car that I recall was the 57 Mercury Turnpike Cruiser, followed in 58 by the Lincoln Continental. But I'll guess that answer is too obvious, and therefore incorrect.
I know it was some kind of Mercury (Monterrey?) because on my morning bus run I go through this little village where one has been up on blocks for years.

Driver, perhaps it's because we are soooooo....OLD! ;He waited 7 weeks for that car.  My mom took our dog to the vet the very next day and rear-ended a truck on the Long Island Expressway which was backing up in the right lane because he missed his exit.  That was the end of my dad's pride and job.  At least he got to drive it a couple of hours.  Honest - no BS - true story!!!  

Actually, from our group of 6, only two remembered and we were the younger ones. But, in our case younger kids knew all the cars, the adults couldn't keep track. Those were the days when cars changed completely every year....kids could learn the new models like learning another language...easy when you are younger.

Those older cars really bring back memories. When I have to think what year we did something I always try to remember what car I was driving at the time...that helps me to recall the date, approximately.

Another car I remember with a reverse windo was the British Ford Anglia....started in 1960, but, the window didn't go up and down.

The cortisone and physical therapy for 2-1/2 months for me did not work.  I ended up having the out-patient arthroscopic surgery 2-1/2 years ago.  Therapy worked for 4 weeks and I only wore a sling for 3 weeks.  The toughest part was this vest they gave me where you have to clip these ice packs onto.  Had to stay in the recliner for 3 days - was not comfortable in my bed at night.

Now, I am completely recovered - for well over two years now.  I tried it the way your doctor suggested, however a torn rotator cuff does not heal by itself - the cotisone is to reduce inflammation and the therapy is to try to improve movement.  Arthroscopic surgery as an outpatient was what made me to decide to have it done - no hospitalization, no nurses with pain medications, and I was in my own comfortable environment.

I wish you the best of luck with the cortisone shots and the PT.

Buick estimates that their customers are 30% more likely to be book readers than the industry average.

Driver....wife and I had a ""spirited"" conversation about the China visit. I agree with you....week to 10 days would be perfect. I couldn't do much more than that for a variety of reasons that are mostly work related. The other reasons, she will be gone over the holidays, leaving the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and not returning until after Christmas. Her attachment to this trip and the country overall is strong. I prefer to spend the Holidays at home with family.

Given she's a teacher, and has been for a couple of decades, she has a lot of vacation time saved up (nearly two years worth). So, as long as she gives the district enough notice (which she apparently did some time ago). She can take that sort of time off. Fact is, given she's been a teacher for 25+ years, she will get full retirement benefits when she's ready to take them. Teachers are on a whole different set up than the majority of us when it comes to retirement and time off.

China's not a cheap trip by any stretch, either. C'est la vie!

So, I haven't taken any vacation yet this year. And, I use it or lose it. I get 4 weeks, but as most of us know, trying to take that much time off in the business community is very hard to do. So, one week it is.

Asked my son if he wanted to go. But, he was just hired by a start up, who's offering a very nice compensation package, including pre-IPO stock options. So, he really can't go either.

That's how I happened onto the cruise in a solo cabin. I'm going alone, but won't be alone. It will be warm (Bahamas) at a time when it will be at least ""chilly"" in the OH Valley. Will come back the week before Christmas, and be ready for the Holidays.

That vapor valve (purge valve) kind of makes sense. My Fusion had that go bad and it ran rough and stalled a couple of times on my way to the dealer. It had to warm up a bit before the symptoms became evident.

Growing up, I would play golf with my dad, uncle and cousin at the golf course on a Navy air base. Course wasn't more than a couple hundred yards from the main runway. Always fun trying to hit an approach shot when a P-3 Orion or F-14 were taking off.

My sister lives just west of O'Hare and is affected by the parallel runways. In the past she had a flight path going over the neighborhood about a block north of her, now they have that one and another about a block south of them. So now the noise has doubled, she says its airport noise in stereo.

I have fun memories of that airport - not from flying in but from my BIL's wedding. They got married in their rooftop apartment on the flightpath after sundown. The jets would roar overhead every few minutes and their landing lights would shine right through the apartment. It was very Star Warzy. Reminded me of all the catfish houses on the Tennessee River when the barges floating by would light up the dining room.

I used to live right under a flight path for O'Hare and had that experience, about every 90 seconds or so a plane would come by so low you could almost make out the faces of people looking through the windows. We were about 3.5 miles or less from the end of the runway.

Now I work with a lady who lives next to Midway. There is no buffer between residential homes and the airport, there are homes literally within 100 yards of the end of runways. Several years ago there was a plane that ran out of runway before it could stop and skidded of the runway. That planes nose ended up in this ladies next door neighbors yard.

3013,October 2015,abacomike,"Back in the late 1980's, was in New Orleans at a conference.  I had a flight back to O'Hare at 2:00 PM, but I received a phone call at my hotel from Delta that due to heavy snow in Chicago, they had cancelled my flight.  They said I should go to MSY and check in with Delta for a possible later flight.  They expected the snow to curtail to flurries later in the afternoon.  So, luggage in tow, I took a cab to the airport and checked in at Delta.  They told me the last flight they had to O'Hare had been cancelled.  So they got me on a Northwest flight that was due to leave at 7:00 PM.  I had a few drinks and dinner on Delta's tab and boarded the Boeing 727 on time.  The cockpit crew announced that it was still snowing, but that by the time we reached Chicago, they expected O'Hare to be accepting incoming flights.  That announcement that O'Hare had not yet reopened but we were leaving anyway was not very reassuring to me or the 8 other passengers on the plane.

We took off and the drinks were on the house.  They served a nice meal and it was a fairly smooth flight.  The captain kept us updated throughout the flight about whether O'Hare was open to traffic.  About 2+ hours into the flight, the captain announced we were starting our decent into the Chicago area and that only one runway had been cleared of snow (18"" had fallen throughout the day) and we had been cleared to land on 32L (IIRC).  

So, we could feel the decent and I looked out of my window and could not see a thing.  All of a sudden, the plane started to climb and the engines were running at ""take off thrust""!  Captain tells us we had been diverted to Milwaukee.  Then, 15 minutes later, the cockpit announced we had been diverted to Rochester.  I said to the passengers near me that going to New York was unexpected.  Of course, about an hour later, the captain announced we were cleared into Rochester, Minnesota.

Up to that point in my life, I had never been in Minnesota - and was not particularly excited about flying into Rochester in February - I had heard stories about how cold it gets up there in the dead of winter.

In any case, we finally land.  The plane stops and I see a truck pulling up to the front exit door with stairway attached.  They had no ""gangway"" at that time in Rochester's terminal - you had to walk to the gate.  It was around 12;00 AM, flurries, etc.  I stand by the exit door - it opens - I took two steps out the exit door and my lips froze together.  I sneezed and a small snow storm formed around my head.  It wasn't just cold - It was the Arctic Circle - 31 degrees below zero without the windchill.  That was my first and last trip to Minnesota.

Next day they put me on a flight to O'Hare and got home at 3:00 PM with 18-20 inches of snow on the ground.  But at least it was a balmy 14 degrees Fahrenheit.

Never saw Skyfall, explain please.

Spoiler Alert - Bond goes back to his childhood home and they show the family cemetery with the name Bond on the headstones. 

It would seem to dispel that theory, maybe the producers put that in to address that theory. However it is possible that the theory is true and the current Bond just happens to have the same name or comes from a family that had the name Bond.

3019,October 2015,Mr_Shiftright,"I just love the evil genius of the new Airlines Business Model.

First they make flying miserable as possible...crowded, lousy food (if any), baggage charges, shrinking the permissable size of carry-ons, etc.

Then, they offer you a way out of the very Hell they created by selling you back the amenities they took away....more leg room, business class seating, lounge privileges, wi-fi, headsets, food, etc.

Then (wait, it gets better), once they cancel your flight and leave you stranded, there's a hotel right next to the terminal so they can torture you again tomorrow.

It's brilliant, really.

No, no, no. It's going to be converted into the TWA Flight Center Hotel. 500 rooms will be added on behind it in a low slung building and the terminal will house the lobby, 6-8 restaurants, and meeting space. There will also be a 10,000 sq. ft. observation deck.

I think CVG also has the same issue that drove Delta to bail out of the old NWA MEM hub - too close to ATL (in the old days CVG was kind of a relief valve for a busy ATL operation and facility) while Detroit is a better geographical fit for the big northern cities. I think the main reason Delta has kept MSP is because of some extensive maintenance facilities located there. I'm a bit surprised that Southwest hasn't moved into Cincinnati since it flies into Dayton and Columbus.

I fly about 50k miles a year on business and another 40-50k miles for personal travel. O'Hare/Midway are quite possibly the two worst airports I connect through with any regularity. Midway is a bit easier to manage because it is smaller, but delays are still frequent and brutal.

3031,October 2015,berri,"Down the road. ORD may get better if they can get through the politics and go to a more parallel runway pattern like ATL. A big issue at ORD is intersecting runways, which they are trying to eliminate, but the public is protesting changes in noise patterns and that is holding some of that effort up. The one thing I'll give ORD is food options; there is a fair assortment, including some local Chicago area joints. Contrast that to ATL when on a long layover. Now MDW is New York's LGA or Washington's DCA. Very land constrained which exacerbates weather and heavy air traffic issues when they occur."
3032,October 2015,stever,"Funny, my sister is a retired flight attendant for United. I've had a few freebies over the years, but I always wished she had gone to work for Delta instead. Just a pretty lousy company overall and the last merger didn't seem to help any either.

Puddle-jumping out of the UP was okay (if they didn't cancel the flight due to a low load), but most flights went through O'Hare and weather would often mess you up. When I did the ANC to Chattanooga run decades ago, Memphis was the best route. Great facility thanks to FedEx's heavy use and so much easier than trying to connect through Atlanta. Chattanooga spent a lot on their terminal 20 years ago and it sat mostly empty, but now they have a few flights again, probably thanks to VW. But my nephew-in-law has to fly a lot for work and skips the local airport and drives to Atlanta. Too many cancelled flights (that low-load issue again)."
3033,October 2015,berri,"For a smaller airport, I always thought MEM had some decent food alternatives. My take on United is that over the years they've had too many leaders intent on diversifying beyond basic airline operations, and it seldom worked. I think the current issue is heavily old United versus old Continental, or the classic New York v. Chicago rivalry. Except, in the case of Continental there is also the Houston factor. Someone has to integrate it like Delta did successfully with Northwest. Maybe United needs to add some better bonus portion into the compensation packages so employees focus on ""one' company and its results. One thing you have to give United though, they have a top notch pilot training center in the Denver area. Hopefully the old Continental people won't screw around with that part."

The nice thing about living in Denver is that I didn't have to do a lot of connections - but, when I did, it was invariably O'Hare. Yes, the intersecting runways are a mess. Yes, I've heard they are trying to sort it out - I hope they can.

I lived here during the switchover from Stapleton to DIA - in fact, I was out of town when it occurred. Left town via Stapleton, returned to DIA. All the problems with DEN were solved when DIA opened - much less issues with weather, specifically. And, room to expand - there's been talk of them adding a 7th runway. The light rail is being extended to the terminal, and an on-site hotel is being built as well. The only issue is that it feels halfway to Kansas, compared to Stapleton.

Plus, Northwest had built a really nice hub terminal at Detroit Metro in the early 2000s that was big and airy and had some decent food choices. I liked it a lot better than their Minneapolis Airport terminal, where I had to kill 8 hours once and had virtually nothing to do.

I haven't flown into O'Hare in ages but I remember what it used to be like and I hated it. It was just too big and busy. I have more experience with Dulles and that is no treat either, but at least they have the cool unmanned subway to move you around now that the mobile lounges are (mostly?) gone.

3039,October 2015,berri,"One thing about the old Denver Stapleton, you couldn't beat the views. But it's runways were too close which like STL could quickly become issues in bad weather.

Alaska is a great airline. United used to own SEA, even operated the terminal that is now Alaska, and I never understood how they allowed themselves to become a tertiary player in that growing market. Guess who is in there picking up the slack behind Alaska; Delta! After their Continental merger, United seems to be losing market share in other key locations like LAX and DEN. I think they need more outside help in their executive suite. United's poor performance stats is fairly easily understood to me, they've consolidated their heaviest operations into some of the worst congestion and weather plagued locations like ORD, SFO, and EWR (Newark)."

Alaska is my primary carrier for domestic travel - they've got a great hub out of Seattle and excellent flight crews.
When I lived in Desert of California, of course I used PSP (Palm Springs) Airport. I used to use Alaska Air almost exclusively whenever I was flying to Seattle, San Francisco or Vancouver. Of all the airlines I have flown (and I don't think there are many I haven't flown), Alaska Airlines was far and above the best of them all.

When I flew back east to see my parents and other family members, I was almost forced to fly American (MD81's and MD83's) into DFW. American had 9 flights a day from DFW to FLL (Ft. Lauderdale) which made it the best airline to fly into Florida's Southeast Coast.

When I moved to Chatsworth, CA (Far Northern LA), I always tried to get a flight out of Burbank to DFW and then on to FLL. American had the best connections into Florida.

I have flown many, many times in and out of ORD and a few times in and out of Midway. I still prefer ORD only because I used to fly to CA or NY frequently when I lived in Chicago to see the folds or my Children and Grandchildren. Flying into NY, most halfway decent connections were American into LGA.

I've flown many times out of PHL and PIT and I agree with all the other posts regarding those two airports. DFW is very difficult to connect in and out of due to the distance between many of the terminals and the crowds of people which made it difficult to catch a bite to eat if my connecting flight was an hour or less.

Of all the airports I hated to fly into, it was San Diego (Lindberg). The fog at times was so bad, we often were diverted into Ontario Airport (about 55 miles east of LA of I-10). Additionally, having only one runway made flying in there rough. If you flew in over the city, it was always a steep drop from the hills/mts. into the airport. If you were landing to the east over the Pacific, that was when we had the most problems with fog and cloud inversions. LGA was my second worst and hated airport to fly into - most of the same reasons - fog and cloud inversions - not to mention the short runways.

3042,October 2015,dino001,"I like Atlanta in the winter (avoid it in summer afternoons). IAD is nice in the non-United concourse -United it is very claustrophobic, dark, narrow passages and low ceilings really bother me. But I still rather go through there than say ORD, or EWR, especially when flying from overseas. I hate those airports when you have to leave the terminal and then go to another with main security lines. That's why ATL or IAD works for me better. Never been to MIA, but people say it's arguably the worst major airport in the US. I have also been in SFO and Denver - those didn't bother me and didn't impress me, either. Denver works well, but the transportation out is a bit pain and rental car prices are always horrendous. I even arranged my vacation week-plus rentals in town couple of times, because the rate was half of that from the airport.

However, if I had to nominate worst airport worldwide, in category of ""developed world"" it is CDG (Paris), hands down. Chaos does not even start to describe it.

Best airports are midsized metropolitan, like my home town, Tampa, or Orlando. Ft. Lauderdale is OK, too. Those are great when you can quickly walk up to a rental car, or parking lot. As I mentioned, I liked CVG for transfers. Seattle or Salt Lake were a bit rundown last time I was there, but they say the former is reviving.

RUG is $1.69.9 at QT about 2 miles from my house. It is even cheaper the further into SC that you go. With Indian Land being at the NC-SC stateline, a lot of Charlotte residents travel across the stateline to SC to get cheaper gas--about .25-.30/gal cheaper. That keeps our gas prices a little higher due to that demand.

I have found that the Charlotte Douglas airport to be quite nice and have not heard of many complaints. It is newer, modern, clean and offers a lot of restaurants, shops and quick access to rental cars, taxis and is only about a 20 minute drive to Charlotte.

While the gov has either overlooked it or been diverted from airbags, I have to ask why the auto industry doesn't just step up and fix issues like this on their own? If true, this is very unsettling, especially because strengthening the seatbacks isn't supposed to be that expensive. Just do it and add 10 bucks to the vehicle price.

Back in 1985, a fellow middle school principal and I took an American Airlines DC10 out of Ohare headed for San Diego. It was the last non-stop out of Chicago's Ohare so we took off at 8:00 PM.  We had to be in LaJolla the next morning in order to present a concept we had developed to other school administrators (250+).

Normally it's about a 3+ hour flight but we were encountering heavy headwinds and severe turbulence which forced the pilot to slow down as the turbulence was widespread and he was unable to circumnavigate sufficiently to avoid it.  After 4+ hours in the air we started our decent into San Diego.  There was quite a bit of fog east of the airport over the Pacific coastline.  Unfortunately, they would not allow us to land to the west due to noise restrictions over the city (normally we would land to the west on that flight but we were 2-hours late).  So we started our approach out over south Orange County and encountered fog almost immediately.  

He turned south about 6-7 miles out over the Pacific and then turned east for his final approach (or what we thought would be his final approach).  He was waved off as he was coming in too high and we had to go around again but only after a steeply banked turn to the south to avoid the city.

By the time we finally landed it was after 11:00 PM.  We got our rental car and arrived at our hotel right about midnight.  We were exhausted.  We had reserved a two-bedroom suite which the conference paid for.  We didn't get to sleep until nearly 2:00 AM and had to be at the conference at 8:00 AM.  Needless to say, it was one of the worst 2-day business trips I had ever experienced.

Coming into Lindbergh field once is bad enough - but twice over the Pacific coastline is more than bad enough.  What scared the day lights out of me (not to mention the stress this had on my colon - if you get my drift), was that sharp turn to the south as we flew over the airport.

Not one of my better flying experiences, to be sure!!!

Delta makes it a hub, raises fares, blocks other airlines from coming in (with the help of the airport board) and things go pretty crazy.

Delta pulls out. And, since the airport board locked out all of Delta's competitors, DVG is a ghost town compared to what it once was. Now, they're begging airlines to come in. The other airlines remember all to well being snubbed when they were asking for gates.

Wow! I pay less than that for 4 vehicles two of which have collision. About a million of total liability if I remember.

One thing that really bothers be about those walking petri dish of STD's Bond movies is that no spy would act like he does. The one thing a spy wants to do is blend into his/hers surroundings and not be noticed, not stand out like Bond does. A spy will much more likely drive a Chevy than an Austin Martin.

Not to mention that it would be less noticeable and less destructive to send in a company of Marines to take care of the situation than it would to send in Bond.

Explorer...it's been so long since I watched Ronin, I forgot what was in the case. I'll have to re-watch it again, soon.

Cincinnati International Airport (CVG) was NOT supposed to be in KY. Imid mentioned Lunken, which did have some flooding issues from the Ohio River. Local neighbors also wanted compensation for noise issues (which never happened). But, it was supposed to be expanded into what the airport in KY is today.

Graft and corruption have plagued CVG. During its heyday in the '90s and early '00s, Delta had a hub there, with plenty of back room greenbacks changing hands giving Delta complete control of the airport and high fares, in return for some ""contributions"" to the board that oversaw the airport.

Delta pulled out and moved its hub to Detroit when they bought NORTHWEST airlines, Leaving a big hole in a large airport. There are now two whole terminals that are modern, but mostly empty given the malfeasance that has gone along with CVG.

I fly a lot....almost every week. I've flown 2 million miles out of CVG, alone. I take charters out of Lunken (much, much easier way to travel) when going to New York. The rest, I go through CVG or Dayton. It's coming back, but it's nowhere near what it was a dozen years ago.

Lots of investigations happened when Delta pulled out, but no one was indicted. Grease the right palms and you can get out of most criminal activities.

3082,October 2015,dino001,"I flew through it couple of times (plane changes with Delta) and I always liked it. It was clean, nicely laid out, even tram shuttle service was better than in many other airports with similar inter-terminal transportation systems. It's sad that Delta pulled out, but it did make sense after Northwest acquisition. Detroit and Minneapolis are both too close, even though they are not nearly as pleasant as CVG. This is the price we pay for the consolidation. When I came into this country in 1998, there were something like 7 national ""majors"" and several large regional airlines. Southwest was already more than a startup, but much wasn't a major just quite yet. Now we have four domestic majors left (including Southwest) plus Spirit (from what I heard it's basically a American version of Ryanair) and almost no regional carriers left. Bunch of cities lost their hub status, coincidentally middle of the country was hard hit (CVG, Cleveland, St. Louis, Memphis). It almost begs somebody with big ego, ambition and too much money to burn to start another airline. I'm sure he could go to former hubs and get a decent deal on gate leases. But as Warren Buffet said, surest way to become a millionaire is to be a billionaire and start and airline...

And I like this one better from Bullet (that's what the owner claims). Evidently the asking price is $1 million. Owner says it had holes drilled in the car where the cameras were positioned.

Which one really would be faster....my guess, the Mustang?


If you watch the movie you can see that Charger wallow in the turns and spit off hub caps. I think the Mustang had a modified suspension so it wasn't really a fair fight.

Straight line I think the Mustang might have the edge because I think it was lighter.

I think looks-wise I'd choose the Charger but back then I was a Mopar fan so......

3108,October 2015,abacomike,"It seems every two years my auto insurance company comes up with an 18%-20% increase in my rates, no matter who I happen to be insured with at the time - it's a two year cycle.

Two years ago, I was insured with That Statue of Liberty Company (name withheld). They had outstanding rates for my car and I carry very high limits of liability and uninsured motorist. At renewal time, I received a $350 yearly increase in my rates (this company's policies run 12 months, not 6 months). So, after searching for another insurance company, I found a better and less expensive policy with that ""reptilian"" company. I was with them for 2 full years and, guess what - rates increased effective November 30th by $$240 per year ($120 for 6 month policy). It never fails to amaze me how stupid these insurance companies are when they raise rates out of sight on policy holders like me who drive 8,000-9,000 miles a year and have no claims, tickets, accidents, etc. They end up forcing their best drivers to seek insurance from competing companies. So I told them to let my policy expire as of November 30th and I went with another company.

I am now back with the Statue of Liberty Company (the same one I was with 2 years ago) at a savings of $450 per year with the exact same coverages. It's a game of musical chairs that I prefer not playing. I want to stay with my insurance company - I don't like having to go with another company every 2 years.

I realize it's my zip code and my credit score that are the major factors that determine what I am doing to pay for auto insurance, (my credit score is in the 800's so it is more zip code than anything else.), but if the insurance companies were smart, they would have other determiners or variables so they wouldn't end up driving off their best customers. But, alas, I guess I am going to have to go through this every two years until I have to stop driving. Just makes no sense to me at all.

I know most of you have similar frustrations with auto insurance policies, but down here in South Florida, you can almost wager that after 2 years, you will have a major increase in rates on your auto policy.

The Steve Jobs movie is based on the biography that was released just after his death. My understanding is that the movie barely touches upon what made Steve Jobs tick. Then again, the movie is a dramatic interpretation and really can't be used as a basis for a true look at the man. I read the biography. IMHO, Jobs was a genius with the ability to see many moves ahead of the competition. He was detail oriented to the point of being obsessive. If something was part of his vision, no amount of contrarian arguments could change his mind. His interpersonal skills suffered due to his laser focus on the other parts of his life. I wouldn't be surprised if he would have been diagnosed somewhere on the Asperger's spectrum.
Many Aspergers diagnosed individuals score at the genius level on the performance IQ test.  One of the first intelligence tests used to diagnose Aspergers in children was the WISC-R (Wechsler Intelligence test revised). It provided IQ's in 3 formats - a Verbal IQ, a Performance IQ, and a full Scale IQ which was a weighted average of the verbal and performance IQ's.

The performance part of the test was
merely laying out guidelines for achieving a series of goals or strategies  by providing the subject with instructions without any verbal interaction between the tester and the subject (I.e. Place a series of boxes in their correct sizes on top of one another.?!onñyother words, read the instructions and complete the task using paper and pencils The second part of the test was all verbal - give an instruction verbally or ask a question of the subject and the subject would verbally complete the task - no paper or pencil tasks were provided - just verbal interaction with the tester.

The results would be analyzed and compared wth subjects from throughout the country.  If there was a significant difference between the verbal and performance IQ's, it was a red flag that there was a learning disability present in the subject.  If the Verbal IQ score was 1 łor more standard deviations lower than the Perfprmance score (15 points is 1 standard deviation from the mean of 100)
it represented a communications disorder which, by definiylyulllllllually Aspergers.  Aspergers children and young adults also exhibit very high performance IQ scores (often at a genius level of 138-145) but  below average verbal IQ scores (often in the EMH/TMH ranges (educably mentally handicapped/trainable mentally handicapped).

My grandson (the younger boy) has Aspergers and his test results were exceedingly high in performance (non-verbal) 144 IQ and 76 Verbal IQ.  Those results are indicative of a communication disorder/Aspergers.

Mike, first regarding Steve Jobs and a Aspergers; That is a real possibility. People knew he as probably a genius even at an early age, but, he struggled in primary school.....a teacher took him under her wing in Grade 4 and that made a huge difference. He was a tough guy, but he seemed to have a heart as he developed relationships with some people, including his daughter - eventually.

About his death and the Pancreatic cancer he had....he probably would have survived if he got real medical attention, and had not depended on the holistic natural scammers. Quote from wiki:

Despite his diagnosis, Jobs resisted his doctors' recommendations for medical intervention for nine months,[112] instead relying on a pseudo-medicine diet to try natural healing to thwart the disease. According to Harvard researcher Ramzi Amri, his choice of alternative treatment ""led to an unnecessarily early death.""[109] Cancer researcher and alternative medicine critic David Gorski disagreed with Amri's assessment, saying, ""My best guess was that Jobs probably only modestly decreased his chances of survival, if that.""[113] Barrie R. Cassileth, the chief of Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center's integrative medicine department,[114] said, ""Jobs's faith in alternative medicine likely cost him his life.... He had the only kind of pancreatic cancer that is treatable and curable.

wow, GG, $64k? That's a higher sticker than my V sport!

I just checked and I can get a 528ix up that high (higher, even), but it does take alot of options to do so.
Q....I was surprised by the MSRP, too. But, like for like (compared to my '14), that's the sticker. I had thought Cadillac said they reduced the price. Could have fooled me.

On the other hand, things like Nav and a sunroof are now standard in the ones I was looking at, instead of optional as they were on my '14.

BTW, not sure if the dealer is pulling info out of the air or not, but he said there would be no CTS Sport of '16.....just a CTS V.

3122,October 2015,driver100,"Hi Iluvmysephia1, I didn't reply to your request because I don't consider myself enough of an expert to know if Tampa/St Petes is the best place in Florida to be. I like it a lot for our purposes, but you may want to research other areas too. Bradenton is nearby and that seems pretty nice, Sarasota, Fort Meyers, Naples (if you got the $$$$s and care about that) are nice areas too.

I like Tampa/St Petes because the temp is a little more moderate - being in the middle. My wife and I prefer areas where there are more regular type people....guess down to earth. We like observing the beautiful people and seeing their way of life once in awhile, but, don't choose to live in that competitive environment.

Tampa/St Petes offers all the great things Florida has to offer, swimming, fishing, natural areas, nice weather, affordable housing, great restaurants and shopping etc. I believe crime happens in certain areas and usually takes place after 12 or so. I doubt if it is worse than any other area.

I wouldn't want to live in say The Keys or Key West. It would take hours to get anywhere, like to another city or an airport or major hospital, and everything is expensive. A nice place to visit.....once, just to see it, but, not a practical place to live.

Arizona sounds nice too, and I have been there.....really depends on what is important to you.

Nice area, good view of ""the"" bridge from Fort De Soto, and I've always liked St. Pete since doing a couple of band trips there in the 60s. But the traffic can be bad.

Cadillac update....picked out a replacement...http://jeffwylerfairfield.com/New-2016-Cadillac-CTS-Cincinnati-OH/vd/29926623

So, I guess what's supposed to happen is the dealer submits the VIN# to Cadillac and they take care of all the paperwork. According to the dealer this could take anywhere between 2-4 weeks before we do the swap

Still a little sheepish about going down this route, and don't necessarily trust Cadillac enough that they'll actually make this happen.

Rented a Chevrolet Sonic while travelling for work last week. Entry level cars have come a long way. It was way under-tired. I'm sure Chevy is using skinny, low rolling resistance tires on this, and they were squirelly on the highway.

But, the car can travel on the interstate at 80 MPH with ease. Actually was quite comfortable and got up to speed reasonably quickly. A little noisy getting to speed, but once there it quieted down nicely for cruising.

It had bluetooth for my phone (which actually worked). Kind of a weird mix of analog (RPM) and digital (speedo, gear select, etc) guages.

Drove it around Detroit, Plymouth and Ann Arbor. Probably put 100-125 miles on it. Put $5 of gas in it to top it off before returning it to Hertz. Pretty darned frugal.

I'd consider it if I were looking for an around town runabout....certainly worlds better than a Smart Car.

You're not alone, ab!  The last movie I actually saw in a ""movie theater"" was Judge Dredd with Sylvester Stalone.  That was the last time I was inside a movie theater - I sometimes wonder if that was the worst movie I ever saw or the second worst movie I ever saw which turned me off to ever going into a movie theater again!  

I either wait for the film to come up on HBO or one of the other premium channels or I just order it as a PPV - $5,00 - $7.00 per film in HD.  I sure don't like the ambiance of a movie theater (sneezing, coughing, popcorn all over the floors, etc.

Whenever I want to see a movie with one of my lady friends, we go out for dinner and then return to my place for drinks and a good movie - and a little ""dessert"" if the mood is appropriate.  And I can pause the movie if a potty break is needed.  Most of my PPV movies are 2-day rentals so I can watch it again if I was distracted (if you get my drift) the next day.

Ahh, isn't technology a wonderful thing?

Actors are such that it takes half of the movie to realize it's the same person who played in a movie you saw five years ago and another one, than another one, finally realizing he/she was in a dozens, looking and sounding completely different in each of those dozens.

I think Damon is a bit of both, which is often the case. He showed some range. Similar Leonardo diCaprio, he started as this pretty boy, but today he can do much more.

@oldfarmer50:

I've been thinking about your comment about considering 19"" wheels and tires for you Mustang.  There is no doubt that sharp wheels can ""make the car"" if you know what I mean.  

You have to consider the fact that you would have to put all-season tires on those wheels - not performance summer tires which really make the difference in handling.  Summer high performance tires like I have on my car should not be driven when temperatures go below 45-50 degrees Fahrenheit.  They can ""crack"" and reduced traction and handling result.

If I couldn't use 19"" high performance summer tires on my car, I would not have bought the Optional Mercedes-Benz 19"" Wheels.  I would have kept the 18"" AMG wheels and all-season tires.  That's why my brother did not get them - in the Jacksonville area, temps during the winter range from the mid to upper 30's at night to the mid 50's during the day.

As for where to buy the wheels if you decide to go with 19"" wheels, I recommend wheels and tires approved by Ford to make sure your warranty remains in tact.  If you have a problem attributable to non-approved wheels and tires, I think you'd be in trouble.  Just some food for thought.  
Well, I like to take flights of fancy that often lead me beyond my economic reality. I was actually considering getting 19"" wheels with summer tires to use late May through September and then switching back to the OEM 18"" w/all seasons for October through April. But $3600 for wheels and another $1000 for tires keeps that plan firmly in fantasy land.

Shame since my down the street Ford store just put three 2016 5.0 Mustangs out front with the larger wheels and they do look a lot better.

Maybe I'll win the lottery or maybe I'll do the summer tires on my 18s May-September and switch back to all seasons in cool weather. Cheaper but I hate taking tires on and off alloys that frequently.

It seems really really weird, downright wrong, the way the market works in this one regard. The dealership will let their salesmen drive a new car for 6 months, accumulate 5k miles, and claim it is still a ""new car"", and you should pay new car prices, because it has never been titled. But if you have to take ownership, title the car before you can resell it, it depreciates a huge amount as a used car, even if you put no miles on it.

Makes no sense at all. One reason that I would never buy a ""demonstrator"".

My wifes car was a ""demonstrator"", they tried the ""it's new"" thing with the price. I countered that if we wanted the car with 6K miles on it we could go to a different dealer and get it ""used"" for a thousands less. We were able to get it for less than what another dealer had for the same model with the same miles used. Smart phones and the local dealers assoc. website are great.

I read the biography. IMHO, Jobs was a genius with the ability to see many moves ahead of the competition. He was detail oriented to the point of being obsessive. If something was part of his vision, no amount of contrarian arguments could change his mind. His interpersonal skills suffered due to his laser focus on the other parts of his life.

You get a price you like for a car, you go home and tell your family, the neighbors, your friends that you will be buying a new car the next day.

You are pretty excited. Then you go in to buy at the agreed price and their are extras plus things they didn't tell you. It's a technique to make you pay more so you won't have to tell all these people you don't have a new car. It even works psychologically on the consumer because now he will convince himself he has to have the new car.
I had that happen to me once, it was the dealership that my sister used to buy her cars from. I walked out there so fast it would have made your head spin. Not only did they lose my sale they lost all my sisters sales from that point on as well as a few others I could name.

Shifty, if most of the movie takes place ""off-planet"", then it's Sci-Fi to me.  Maybe not to most people, but if the movie has space suits, rocket ships, and it takes place on a world other than our beloved Planet Earth, how bad can it be?

Oh, there have been some really bad Sci-Fi flicks mass produced in or around Hollywood, CA - but those aren't/weren't within my realm of true Sci-Fi lovers' films.

Consider ""Forbidden Planet""!  That film starred Walter Pidgeon, Leslie Nielson and of course ""Robbie the Robot!""  The special effects were outstanding for a film made in 1956 - in technicolor no less.  The acting was great except for Anne Francis.  But the script had some meat to it and science fiction had less to do with its success - it was a telling of what unlimited power placed in the hands of mortals can do to an entire race/culture of humanoids.

Remember the movie ""THEM""?  It starred James Whitmore along with giant ants that were genetically altered after several ""A-Bomb"" tests conducted in the New Mexico Deserts.  James Arness also starred with Edmund Gwynn (Miracle on 42nd Street Santa).  Scarey movie (imagine waking up in the middle of the night with a 15 foot ant about to bite/sting you) that is still considered a Classic Sci-Fi film among film critics.

Yes - I am a Sci-Fi lover, but even I have reservations about ""Brain Robbers From Outer Space"" (2004) or ""Snow Shark: Ancient Snow Beast"" (2011).  I'm even embarrassed to reveal that I have actually seen flicks like these.  But, you have to take the bad (some just plain dumb) with the good (like Star Wars).

Interesting article you linked to. Most interesting part? This:

The fact is that all U.S. midsize cars contain the same parts count, the same engine and transmission technology, the same safety equipment, the same ABS brakes and traction control, the same or similar seats and interiors—and many of these parts even come from the same suppliers. A Chevrolet Malibu's material cost is within a couple percent of that of a BMW 3-Series.
Is this really true? “A Chevrolet Malibu’s material cost is within a couple percent of that of a BMW 3-Series”


I am a big fan of iMax, it makes a huge difference. And I’m a really big fan of the classic science fiction, yes, including Forbidden Planet and Them. And who could possibly leave out The Day The Earth Stood Still?

As to Steve Jobs, I know a number of people who worked for him, back in the day. He was a tyrant, a truly terrible boss. I met him once, had an argument with him about Motorola 68020 instruction set versus Intel x86. He did not like to hear anyone who disagreed with him, about anything.

I am not a fan of “rubber band tires”. The first time you hit a pothole, and have to file an insurance claim to replace the tire and the wheel, you will have severe doubts yourself.

Ever look behind that shiny skin on a car or take off a valve cover? Bunch of parts seemingly cobbled together and a bunch of spot welds behind the paint. I guess the art is bringing all those components together in a working assembly, and the good artists manage to make 'em perform well and run efficiently. I haven't eyeballed, say a Tesla, but jeeze, sometimes I think there hasn't been all that much advancement in automobile engineering in the last 50 years. Nothing like circuit board design.

I first became jaded around age 9 or 10 when I noticed someone's ""cheapo"" Chevy had the same Body by Fisher logo on the door sills as my Daddy's '53 Buick. Why pay more for a brand that's not much different from the competition underneath?"

Per your comment about ""rubber band tires"" (I am assuming you meant very low profile high performance tires), it's actually the wheel that breaks down, not the tire.  But you are correct in your assessment. 

I have mentioned before that if I lived in New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, etc., or any other major mettopolitan area, I would not have any tires or wheels on my car that were low profile or expensive (i.e. like what I have on my E400 now).  Because of the extreme temperature ranges those northern cities experience, the road surfaces crack, separate, and thus pot holes develop quickly - cities and counties just cannot keep up with repairs and repaving.

Down here in South Florida, our temps are not extreme and we do not have potholes or cracks on our surface streets like the have up north.  Our roads, streets and highways are some of the best in the country.  Because high performance summer tires improve handling and cornering to such an extent, I wouldn't have anything else on my car.  They do wear much faster because they are made with a much softer compound.  I just turned 8000 miles on my odometer and the front tires are about 3/5 worn.  The rear tires are about 2/5 worn.  Thus, I expect to replace the front tires at about 14,000 miles.  Because the tires have staggered sizes front and rear, I cannot rotate them which would improve tire tread life.  But it is well worth the additional costs involved because of the significant improvement of handling and cornering and responsiveness.

Ever get up north ta Tampa Bay? Around 2006 I made a brief job search for an Allied Healthcare job there that proved futile. Was wondering if you like Tampa Bay at all. I ended up taking a job in Geronimo's old homeland - Cochise County of SE Arizona. Loved living there so much that I believe I will retire there. There are the old Fort Bowie ruins there - that is the Fort the Cavalry held Geronimo in after they captured him - plus the Chiricahua Mountains are absolutely gorgeous and unusual spectacles that hardly anyone knows about. They are southern Arizona's answer to the north of Arizona's Grand Canyon.

so you could buy outright with financing at one price, or lease with different incentives (at a different cap cost, but most leasees probably don't pay attention to what that is!)

Hi everybody. Still loving it. We don't drive it much. Got it in mid February and it has about 5,600 miles. About 1500 of that was a road trip to Crater Lake, OR --> Mendocino, CA --> back to Sacramento.

Everybody comments on how good it looks and how nice the interior is (I have an Overland.) The neighbor across from my house had never talked to me in 3 years, never even waved hello. When he saw it, he came over and talked to me for about 20 minutes because he's interested in buying one (not sure if he ended up getting one. He's moved.)

The only problem has been with the radio. When you start it up, the XM radio sometimes takes a bit (20 seconds or so) before you can change stations. It hasn't bothered me enough to do something about it.

Glad you are lovin the GC. My XM can take awhile....probably 10 to 15 seconds at the most to find the station when I first start up.

I've been thinking about your comment about considering 19"" wheels and tires for you Mustang.  There is no doubt that sharp wheels can ""make the car"" if you know what I mean.  

You have to consider the fact that you would have to put all-season tires on those wheels - not performance summer tires which really make the difference in handling.  Summer high performance tires like I have on my car should not be driven when temperatures go below 45-50 degrees Fahrenheit.  They can ""crack"" and reduced traction and handling result.

If I couldn't use 19"" high performance summer tires on my car, I would not have bought the Optional Mercedes-Benz 19"" Wheels.  I would have kept the 18"" AMG wheels and all-season tires.  That's why my brother did not get them - in the Jacksonville area, temps during the winter range from the mid to upper 30's at night to the mid 50's during the day.

As for where to buy the wheels if you decide to go with 19"" wheels, I recommend wheels and tires approved by Ford to make sure your warranty remains in tact.  If you have a problem attributable to non-approved wheels and tires, I think you'd be in trouble.  Just some food for thought.

Check out Craigslist. A lot of people replace their factory wheels with aftermarket, and sell the factory wheels.

19"" might be tough to find used though.

I have been reading a lot about the subject of sociopaths, and narcissists and found it fascinating. Often sociopaths do well in business because in certain situations they just don't care about anyone. They don't let their emotions get in the way, they can be unscrupulous and they like to win at all cost. Sociopaths probably make up 6% of the population so be wary, and be on guard when buying a car or anything else.....they see you as the enemy who has to be beaten. My guess is the other 94% of the population can be sociopaths to some extent, on a sliding scale.

I am not saying Jobs was a sociopath, he might just be a narcissist. In fact, this seems more likely. He worked hard...which sociopaths don't do, and his world revolved around him.

It is hard to diagnose completely, and both are called personality disorders these days. Jobs is there somewhere, but, we need those people in the world too, just don't get in their way.

3203,October 2015,graphicguy,"We'll see how this plays out. The dealer says Cadillac Corp really leaves some of the communications with them regarding the buy back open for interpretation....for example...

-""The customer will be credited for any out of pocket cash contribution made on the old unit""

What does that mean? Delivery fees? Gas and time taking the car back and forth to the dealer for service?

-""The customer will be eligible for any rebates offered on the replacement unit""

I thought it was supposed to be a like for like swap? What if the rebates weren't nearly the same on the old unit as on the new unit?

-""The customer will not be charged any useage fees"".

Again, I don't know what that means. Does that mean they won't charge me any mileage, or wear and tear fees? That is my interpretation, but the dealer says they need clarifiction.

-""The customer will be allowed to buy any dealer in stock unit for a price equal to the price paid for the old unit. Dealer will sell new unit to Mr. ""GG"" for net cost of unit, with all rebates going to Mr. ""GG"". All dealer holdback and dealer incentives are to be deducted from the cost of the vehicle.""

The dealer is about 10 miles (maybe less) from my house. I've never had much luck striking a deal with them in the past. They are part of a large dealership group in Cincinnati. But, as I mentioned ealier have totally turned over managment and staff over the last several weeks. So, maybe it's a sign they are looking to go in a different direction, which would be a good thing for them.

This is sort of a diffent business transaction for both of us, though. They seem to be willing to work with me for what will probably end up being no money for them.

I think this is going to very quickly become “sticky”. It very definitely does NOT sound like you trade keys and walk away, very much NOT.

Reading all of the above, carefully, more than once, I wind up with this:

If you paid $41k for the old Cadillac, and the new Cadillac is $51, then you will owe the difference, $10k. If there are $3k in incentives, then that would be deducted, and you would owe $7k.

All my numbers are made up, by the way.

And it becomes even stickier if you traded in on the old one. Say the old one had an MSRP of $50k, and your trade was really worth $5k. The dealer will often write the papers as
$50,000 minus $10,000 trade in, you owe us $40,000


What I’m saying here is that the papers you sign very often don’t bear much resemblance to the reality of the deal. So who is to say / determine how much, exactly, you paid for the old Cadillac? Are they just going to go by the window sticker, the MSRP?

If the Lemon Lawyer was involved, at least according to the one I spoke to, they'd charge an additional amount to compensate for their services, and Cadillac would pay for it.

So, I'm figuring the ""new"" '16 CTS lists for about $64K. Invoice is about $60K. Holdback is about $2K. Another $4K from Cadillac in purchase rebates. Another $2K in rebatres comes off since I'm a current Cadillac owner. Given all that, I'm figuring a price of $52K for the '16.

My '14 stickered for about the same price. But, my purchase price was about $8K less because of rebates at the time.

That's not relevant, though. Because what I agreed to was an even swap with no out of pocket.

So, lots of questions here. Dealer has a bunch, too. Cadillac has my purchase info on my '14, so none of this should be dificult to figure out. They get the old car back with the title signed over to them, I get the new car with the title signed over to me. Sounds simple to me.

You get a price you like for a car, you go home and tell your family, the neighbors, your friends that you will be buying a new car the next day.

You are pretty excited. Then you go in to buy at the agreed price and their are extras plus things they didn't tell you. It's a technique to make you pay more so you won't have to tell all these people you don't have a new car. It even works psychologically on the consumer because now he will convince himself he has to have the new car.

I received a letter back from him that he had officially inquired why my Dad's money had not been paid.

Well, this morning, my checking account was increased by $648 due to an electronic deposit from Social Security.  My brother got his by check.  

I guess sometimes it takes an Act(ion) of Congress(man) to get this government of ours to do what is supposed to get done.  I sent Congressman Deutch an email thanking him.

It seems that the one issue is the relative amount of rebates/incentives that may have applied originally versus now. I would exclude dealer discounts or other price reductions that were not offered by Cadillac corporate from that.

So, I guess what's supposed to happen is the dealer submits the VIN# to Cadillac and they take care of all the paperwork. According to the dealer this could take anywhere between 2-4 weeks before we do the swap

Still a little sheepish about going down this route, and don't necessarily trust Cadillac enough that they'll actually make this happen.

Rented a Chevrolet Sonic while travelling for work last week. Entry level cars have come a long way. It was way under-tired. I'm sure Chevy is using skinny, low rolling resistance tires on this, and they were squirelly on the highway.

But, the car can travel on the interstate at 80 MPH with ease. Actually was quite comfortable and got up to speed reasonably quickly. A little noisy getting to speed, but once there it quieted down nicely for cruising.

It had bluetooth for my phone (which actually worked). Kind of a weird mix of analog (RPM) and digital (speedo, gear select, etc) guages.

Drove it around Detroit, Plymouth and Ann Arbor. Probably put 100-125 miles on it. Put $5 of gas in it to top it off before returning it to Hertz. Pretty darned frugal.

I'd consider it if I were looking for an around town runabout....certainly worlds better than a Smart Car.

You would be misguided to trade it in immediately before giving it a few months to drive it and enjoy it.  It will be worth the same money on trade in 3 months as it would be on trade now.  It is still a titled car.

It seems really really weird, downright wrong, the way the market works in this one regard. The dealership will let their salesmen drive a new car for 6 months, accumulate 5k miles, and claim it is still a ""new car"", and you should pay new car prices, because it has never been titled. But if you have to take ownership, title the car before you can resell it, it depreciates a huge amount as a used car, even if you put no miles on it.

Makes no sense at all. One reason that I would never buy a ""demonstrator"".

A demo car can be sold as new with full factory warranty, however they are usually sold below invoice.  If you know of anyone who paid full price for a demo, you can tell them for me that they are ""loony""!

Most new car dealerships no longer provide demos for most employees or for customers.  The Owner, GM and GSM are the exceptions.  When I was s sales manager, I was not given a demo - but I did receive an allowance to lease one for 12-24 months.

Demos are rare these days because salesmen take the customer out to the new car inventory to pick a car from stock and that is the car the demo.  Thus many new cars will have 15-45 miles on the odometer because they were demoed.  I would not buy a demo with over 50 miles on it even at a below invoice price.

There are two alternative treatments remaining.  One of them is called ""Vicara Pack"" along with Ribarivin (the drug I took before that made me very weak).  The two drugs work in conjunction with each other, but I have to take them for 48 weeks which means serious side effects for a long period of time.

I have what is called Genotype 1A Hep C.  Genotype 1B reacts better to Harvoni than the type I have - my type a more resistant virus.

The pharmacy (specializes in high cost drugs and works with insurance companies, doctors and drug foundations for helping with Copays) said they are working as fast as they can to get my insurance company to authorize the drugs and will attempt to apply to the drug foundation to help with the thousands of dollars for copays ($4000+).

I'll probably know something next week.  I may have to hire someone to grocery shop and care for me during the day because of the serious side effects.

I spoke to my doctor and he reiterated that there are new treatments being tested all the time, however there are three effective treatments now available which are approved by the FDA.  All approved FDA treatments were ""fast-tracked"" and pharmaceutical companies are still acquiring data surrounding effectiveness and cute rates as well as common and uncommon side effects.  Thus, these drugs are still being monitored because they were fast-tracked.  Remember, not all trials have known side effects or cure rates.  This regimen they want to put me on gas a 94% cure rate for Hep C genotype 1A.

Both of the turbo charged V6 engines are quicker and get better gas mileage than the V8. And the 2.7L twin turbo “feels” even faster / quicker than the larger, more powerful 3.5L. What’s not to like?

On the downside, I have stated before that the longevity of this brand new twin turbo engine is somewhat of a question in my mind. If I were to keep the truck past the basic warranty (unlikely, as a card carrying member of CCBA), then I will buy an extended factory warranty.

As for CR, all I know is that it's reliability ratings have generally tended to reflect my experience as an owner of different vehicles over the years.

I'm not embarrassed to admit I like a smooth luxury ride on long hauls!

A friend of mine, a retired woman in her early 60's, recently asked my advice about purchasing a used car. She is going to be taking some road trips, with her elderly mother, visiting grandkids and other relatives scattered around the countryside.

She wanted a used car that was affordable, reliable, and extremely comfortable for her and her mother on long road trips. After a brief pause for thinking, I came back with Lincoln Town Car.

I myself own a Cadillac DTS, which would also fit the bill. But the Cadillac is just not as reliable, easy to work on, cheap to fix as the Town Car. It is more fun to drive, which is why I chose it over the Town Car.

The Avalon would probably be a good choice as well, but I'm not really familiar with them.

GG, this is a really good point.

Also, a 2016 is worth an extra $12 to $14K at least. I would drive it for awhile and see if you like it, it may be fine and you may love it as ab does his Caddie. If you don't like it you could trade and you would be pretty close in $s.

Good point was that it would have zero miles on it....not be a demo or something. And, most important:
THE WARRANTY BEGINS WHEN YOU PICK UP THE CAR. I have seen cases where this was part of your original warranty, so they consider this the fix, and you just have the remaining time on the original.

Then carve into the instrument panel on the one you have that it ""is a Lemon"", so no one else will get stuck with it......but, someone will, and that will be the last Cadillac the will buy.

All good advice, as you might be able to make up your purchase price now.

However, I'd advocate against keeping the new '16 for any amount of time. I'd imagine the depreciation really hits once you cross 100 miles as opposed to reselling an essentially brand new car. Add to that the fact you know the Cadillac dealers may or or more than likely may not honor the warranty terms, the loaner car terms, or any other part of your contract based on how they feel that particular day, you are better off getting rid of the car ASAP. The last repair on my Neon was completed the day before it was disposed of in a quick sale, and yes, I was worried it might break down just taking it to where it needed to be sold (one trip and one day is too long in my opinion). Drive it STRAIGHT to where you will sell it. Advertise the sale if you are doing private party sale starting right now if you intend to do the deal with Caddy. Why run into a situation again where you need warranty service and are stuck with the rental car bill yet again?

Run, don't walk.



Even better, and I just thought of this; send the best message to GM by having a tow truck pick up your new '16 CTS and have it delivered with no additional mileage put on it to your buyer at their location of choice.

CR earlier had said Tesla was wonderful. The reason is they liked Tesla so they decided they had to be reliable and perfect because they like the idea of ""green"" with pollution being somewhere else to make the electricity rather than at the point of use. Sort of like how CR did with toyota many years back--they predicted new model's worthiness based on past experience, and then got burned. Was it the Avalon version of the toyota they had to do a retraction for a few months later?

Tesla was average reliability before it went bad. That tells me that like Dodge, it isn't so terrible the first year or two, but age shows reliability's true colors; sometimes referred to as durability. You have to earn the right to be seen as unreliable by CR, and that is done by building unreliable vehicles. Tesla got a pass because they hadn't built any vehicles.

Sort of like when you open your first line of credit; no credit can be seen as good or bad credit depending on who you ask.

3329,October 2015,imidazol97,"What I'm reading so far is that CR is a good source of information because some people feel that CR's recommendations fit their anecdotal opinions of some cars and CR's recommendations fit what the people feel is the reliability history of some cars.

The same people feel that JD Powers is not good because they don't discriminate between types of problems. They also feel JD Powers reports information that is blurred in some cases, i.e., some vehicle variations such as engines are lumped in with other engines for the same model which have different characteristics.

The JD Powers information comes from random polling which gives it a lot of credibility. This contrasts with CR's data collection which is based on their subscriber list and sending them questionnaires. The subscribers may or may not decide to respond to the questionnaires giving a bias to the results subject to the various psychological quirks of those owners. Also, do the owners get verified as owners of the cars which they claim to own? Or could I report that I have all kinds of problems with my Honda Civic just because I didn't like a Civic?

Also with CR, there's problem with the randomness of their subscriber list. I believe others have asked if they give out the demographic information about their subscribers. I can make generalizations about their subscribes that would suggest that their responses would give biases. Some brands would not be favored while others would be favored because of past images of those brands/models.

So if the CUE in my Cadillac ATS works in most ways but doesn't work well with my cell phone or doesn't work well with certain aspects I want to use, is that a major flaw in the car or a minor one that JD Powers should leave out? If my Mustang kept flipping the AC belt off the pulley at odd times, is that a major flaw or a minor flaw? If someone had their transmission replaced by Ford twice on their Pinto while under warranty and they consider that a report of ""no problems"" because it was taken care of by the company, is that truly no problem even though they love their Pinto and reported it that way to protect the reputation of Pintos?

I have no doubt that most people here like getting historical data about the cars and reliability as well as suitability. It would nice to get a report that is truly a random selection of register owners of said vehicles and get responses without bias. What's needed is a blend of the two systems keeping the best features of both.

Even better would be timely summations of the warranty service that the companies had to do on their vehicles. Seeing that Nissan had to replace lots of alternators due to failures for 9 months of the year and then they fixed the weakness in new production and replacements could be good and could be bad in their reputation record.

JD Powers could rank problems by severity, but they would be making subjective decisions. CR could actually do a random survey of registered owners. I'm participating in a random survey of television viewers in a week or so and reporting my TV choices to a company that compiles the data. CR could afford to actually do a random survey and actually tell us how many are in their samples of 2014 Malibu's, e.g., with the 2.5 L and with the 2.0 L engine. CR doesn't give any indication if their sample size is 500 who reported back in their convenience survey non-random assessment or if they got 5 with the 2.0 L engine.

Went from Lexington KY to Toledo and back last weekend. Besides Cincinnati and Dayton there was some construction at Lima and the sign south of Toledo said 50 miles of construction ahead. A lot of it involved narrow two lanes with the portable concrete barriers on each side. Was kind of scary when a 18 wheeler was really close and you had no room to go anywhere. I do not see how they get that 50 miles done before cold weather shuts down asphalt plants. At two places in the 50 mile stretch the two lanes split into 2 single lanes with the wide median between them."
3331,October 2015,stickguy,"speaking of construction, the Jersey turnpike just went through a major project. As long as I have driven it (30+ years) there was always a huge bottleneck going south at ""the merge"" (exit 8A) where the car and truck lanes came together (dropping from 6 to 5 to 3 in a short period). any even was bad, and some holidays could lead that to back up 5+ miles.

so, they came up with a plan a few years back to extend that down another 15ish miles (estimate!). Was a bit of a pain with the lane shifts, etc. while they replaced all the overpasses, etc. But, it got done last year.

Man, what a transformation. Now, there is no backups, and you breeze through. By the time it finally merges further south, traffic has dispersed enough that it does not seem to be a problem. Plus, they repaved the whole thing (the old parts desperately needed that) and took care of some other bad spots like off ramps.

An interesting list....and we did see it before a little while ago.

I would love to know why the owners wanted to trade in their cars after just one year. It would be great to have a survey...whether it was mechanical problems, warranty problems or just uncomfortable. The Cruze, bmw X1. Mercedes C Class are baffling....would really like to know why owners traded in after one year.

I tend to agree. CR can be useless for little factors that don;t really matter, such as not enough legroom in the rear....well, most people won't buy the car if they use the rear for carrying adults a lot. However, when I see trends, like Land Rovers and Fiats being very unreliable....that is information I can use. If Lexus and Toyota are high on the list that may be of use to me.

I don't think of it as the ultimate, but it is one tool in helping me to decide. If I narrowed my choice down to 2 cars, and CR had one in the top 5% for reliability, and one in the bottom 5%, I would go with the one that is more reliable.

Hey driver

Went from Lexington KY to Toledo and back last weekend. Besides Cincinnati and Dayton there was some construction at Lima and the sign south of Toledo said 50 miles of construction ahead. A lot of it involved narrow two lanes with the portable concrete barriers on each side. Was kind of scary when a 18 wheeler was really close and you had no room to go anywhere. I do not see how they get that 50 miles done before cold weather shuts down asphalt plants. At two places in the 50 mile stretch the two lanes split into 2 single lanes with the wide median between them.
Thanks for the additional information....like CR everything helps. I hate those narrow lanes especially when they zig zag and especially when you have a transport truck right next to you. I will keep that in mind in that area.

speaking of construction, the Jersey turnpike just went through a major project. As long as I have driven it (30+ years) there was always a huge bottleneck going south at ""the merge"" (exit 8A) where the car and truck lanes came together (dropping from 6 to 5 to 3 in a short period). any even was bad, and some holidays could lead that to back up 5+ miles.

so, they came up with a plan a few years back to extend that down another 15ish miles (estimate!). Was a bit of a pain with the lane shifts, etc. while they replaced all the overpasses, etc. But, it got done last year.

Man, what a transformation. Now, there is no backups, and you breeze through. By the time it finally merges further south, traffic has dispersed enough that it does not seem to be a problem. Plus, they repaved the whole thing (the old parts desperately needed that) and took care of some other bad spots like off ramps.

nice to see a road project that actually made a big positive difference!
While I live in the western US, I've had many occasions to drive the NJT when business took me to that part of the country. I do remember the merge, as it was right around the Newark airport. Glad to hear that it's been addressed.

Here in Colorado, the latest discussion has to do with I-70 going up to the ski resorts. At the moment, only 2 lanes in each direction for most of the drive to the major resorts. Lots of debate about toll lanes, railroad options, etc. - all of which would cost major $$$'s.

And in Denver, there is an elevated portion of I-70 that planners want to sink underground (sort of like the Big Dig in Boston). That project is moving forward, slowly.

Good point of view but they probably can't find a problem that no one could detect. They don't examen the ignition switches to see if they are up to standard, they don't check emissions in every car, they don't always test for roll overs though some found those smaller GM SUVs (Tracker I think) could roll over.

They only report on what they find when testing, but, they don't tear the cars apart. I still think they do provide some useful information, but, it has to be weighed and analyzed by the user, just as all info must be analyzed.

I can only speak for myself because I don't personally know enough about all of your daily routines and lives - just what you post over the years.

For me, I love new and classic cars.  But this adoration for the automobile takes up perhaps 1/20th or less of daily life and activities.  My life does not revolve around my automobile - I am more concerned about family, health, quality of life, my future and my happiness.  Cars make me very happy, but only for a month or two after I buy one.  After that, it (the car) becomes just one of many, many things I think about on a daily/weekly/monthly basis and does not supersede anything else in my life.

3347,October 2015,PF_Flyer,"I don't know that my life revolves around my cars, but even working from home, a car (with an ICE at this point) is definitely a major factor in quality of life, for lack of a better term. It's 5 miles to ANYTHING from my house and a minimum of 7-10 miles to the stuff needed to live day to day. While that's certainly walkable or bikeable (I have walked to pick up a car from service at the dealer 5 miles away) there's no way to exist without a personal vehicle here. There is a bus system, but it comes to my neighborhood 3 times a day. Morning, noon, and roughly 6PM. If I tried, for example, to go buy groceries, and took the 7 AM bus, I'd have to take the half hour ride into town, wait for the transfer to the proper bus, take that ride, get the groceries, wait for the bus to get back into town for the transfer to (hopefully) catch the bus that gets back to my place around noon. So the 8 mile trip to the store turns into at least a 5 hour ordeal. If I can't make a connection in time it's the whole day.
As rural as my location is, I always try to turn every trip into a multi-task and keep it to one trip into town a day. So generally that will wind up covering 30 to 40 miles or more. Hence, the need for something with more cargo capacity than a bike and more range than an EV can comfortably guarantee at this point. If I don't really need anything, I stay home for the day. There's always something to work on in the yard

Generally those folks seem to be around 114, although the oldest is currently 116. The Cubs last won in 1908. Add 114, and in 2022 there likely will be nobody on the planet who was alive the last time the Cubs won. Now THAT's a drought

I enjoy talking about them and I love driving them, and I feel very fortunate some guy thought of making an automobile, and that it has developed to this level.

Just got another mailer from some dealer wanting to give me $3100 for my wife's PT Cruiser. It just turned 30k miles so I don't think so.

Didn't think there would be any car worth less than a VW right now.

Saw data that said diesel VW's dropped about 8% in value if affected by the scandal. I really don't see them dropping much unless the government tries to retroactively ban cars that passed their tests. They'd get a face-full of lawsuits if they tried that though.

Golf is going through a rough time. Too expensive for a lot of people, and just takes too much time. Young people don't have the money or the time.

They are trying to revive the game though. Making huge 12 inch holes to speed up the game. There is frisbee golf. 12 hole course instead of 18. Ah, young people just want to play on their computers.

The fastest growing game in the USA is pickleball. Kind of like tennis on a smaller court, use paddles, and the ball is plastic. Seniors are taking it up, not too much running, but can be very active....and it requires some good skills.

Tesla wasn't ranked because it only has one product, the Model S sedan. But Fisher said responses from 1,400 Tesla owners indicated that Tesla has below-average reliability. Owners reported sunroof leaks and problems with the electric motor and the dashboard screen, among other issues.
CR earlier had said Tesla was wonderful. The reason is they liked Tesla so they decided they had to be reliable and perfect because they like the idea of ""green"" with pollution being somewhere else to make the electricity rather than at the point of use. Sort of like how CR did with toyota many years back--they predicted new model's worthiness based on past experience, and then got burned.

3359,October 2015,dino001,"And we are back into Consumer Report discussion. No surprise, where the lines are drawn. Bias! Shout some. Confirmation of real life! shout others. As always, the truth is a bit more complex.

My opinion on CR reliability, they are probably best source for long and short term reliability data wherever sample size is decent, i.e. on either overall brand or large-volume models. They may be less so on smaller models or less popular trims (like top engines). Often they would say so in their tabulation ""not enough data"" - I'd also add there may be plenty of marginal calls, where sample size was just big enough, but not that great. They also explain their reliability ratings, but who would really read those introductions. However, if you do, you find out that all cars, all brands are more reliable and durable as a whole vs. say 30 years ago. However, they give them relative rating vs. the average. Sometimes ""well below average"" can mean ""much better than before, just not as good as others"". In some cases they would do system-by-system rating, where they'd assign percentiles to each of those circles. Finally - they did make a note that the most modern systems, i.e. fuel efficient transmissions, etc. are now focus of their scrutiny. In other words, those things that pushed us over 30 mpg are also things that seem to be breaking down more frequently and are expensive to fix - this is the price we pay for politicians mandating better efficiency because ""it's going to be only a little more expensive"" (don't we always hear this ""only a little more expensive"" hogwash?). Obviously, the manufacturers know they can't jack up their prices too much, so they'll get it back in other ways (cost cutting in components, less testing, etc.) and we will pay them later either by ditching a perfectly good car before the warranty expires, or by paying out of warranty costs.

CR is (IMHO) a great source of information for people who don't particularly care about cars and don't really care how the car drives, but rather whether it is designed to satisfy transportation needs. In other words, if cupholders are right size and good grip, trunk lid doesn't crush groceries, or if seats have enough room. I'm not disparaging those issues, they are important to many people. They will also rate things handling in emergency, but the weight is given much more into utilitarian aspects of the vehicle - which is fine, if that's what you want.

I have no confidence in JD Power, I think their studies are garbage. I'm not saying it because I think they lie (I have no evidence of that), but I question the way they construct those ratings, like calling an inconvenient (in eyes of the user) cupholder a ""quality problem"" and giving it same kind of weight, as say engine gasket blown after a month. Also, calling 3 years ""long term reliability"", etc. Their website is very deceiving, where it allows you to choose a particular trim of a model (say six cylinder engine), but the ratings you get are not for that particular trim, but for the average of all vehicles in that model. I saw that evident, when they rated acceleration ""below average"" on a trim that was fastest in its class at the time (the low engine trim was certainly slow). Essentially, it gave one impression of a much higher ""resolution"" of the study than it really was. That's not an honest assessment. Say ""no data"", don't pretend you know something you don't.

Sorry to keep all of you waiting. I was livid last week.

Update.....in fairness, the paperwork for licensing my car from the dealer was reported wrong. Dealer says it was a BMV mistake. BMV says it was a dealer mistake. At this point, I didn't care. They issued a new title with everything correct. I am listed as the sole owner. Somehow, I still feel something is amiss. But, it SEEMS everything with the title is taken care of.

As far as the buyback.....talked to a couple of lawyers (not my personal lawyer, who originally sent Cadillac a letter). These lawyers specialize in Lemon Law. None of them are local to me, though. The nearest one is a couple of hours away in Columbus, OH. He confirmed that in OHIO, the complaint must indeed go through BBB arbitration first, which is scheduled for this Thursday. I can't be there, and neither can my wife. So, I will participate in the hearing over the phone. He also said they'd want to drive the car, which they can't since I'm not going to be there. I guess if the case is deemed worthy of going forward, then they'll schedule time to drive the car.

During all of this, and while I was raising three kinds of holy hell with Cadillac over the dealers they choose to do business with, a customer service manager got involved and asked if they could offer me a 2016 CTS with a higher sticker price than my '14. I called the Lemon Law attorney back and told him of this offer. He said if the BBB arbitraitor does not authorize a buy back (difficult to do without driving the car to see the problems I have been having) and puts me off another couple of months, its tough to see if I would prevail or not. He said he normally negottiates a new car...not a buy back.

That said, Cadillac seems like they don't want to go to arbitration, even if they rarely lose.

Cadillac sent me the differences between the '14 CTS and the '16. I guess they totally redid CUE, put in an 8 speed trans vs the '14s 6 speed. Just about everything is standard with the exception of the upgrade engine (twin turbo V6 vs the turbo 4 and ""regular"" V6). Nav is now standard, which seems silly given they are now using Apple Car Play and Google Android interfaces. I guess lane keep, lane change, front and rear snesors for parking, etc are now standard, too.

I don't know if they've worn my down or not. I'm wondering if I should just follow someone else's advice here, take the '16, sell it when I get it (and take the ""depreciation hit"") and move on down the road.
The depreciation hit on a '16 with under 100 miles might not be all that bad. I bet there would be dealers and Carmax's that would offer top dollar for something like that.

Actually, what they do, they publish their guide model by model. When it's a carryover, they'd say so. If it's new, they would say so. The reliability prediction is based on previous record of the model, brand and actual data edition, whatever is available. If the model is a carryover with good/bad reliability, they'd mark it accordingly. If it is a brand new model with a consistent multiyear record of good reliability, they'd mark its predicted reliability accordingly. However, if the record is spotty, they would mark it as ""new"" (no prediction). They would not recommend a new model with no reliability prediction (spotty previous years). They would recommend an existing or new model with good ratings and at least average reliability of previous years.

When Toyota and Lexus had some issues a few years back to the point they were no longer consistently good across the models, they took away ""benefit of the doubt"" prediction on new models and Toyota/Lexus had to build it back. I think they did by now.

Also, a 2016 is worth an extra $12 to $14K at least. I would drive it for awhile and see if you like it, it may be fine and you may love it as ab does his Caddie. If you don't like it you could trade and you would be pretty close in $s.

Good point was that it would have zero miles on it....not be a demo or something. And, most important:
THE WARRANTY BEGINS WHEN YOU PICK UP THE CAR. I have seen cases where this was part of your original warranty, so they consider this the fix, and you just have the remaining time on the original.

Then carve into the instrument panel on the one you have that it ""is a Lemon"", so no one else will get stuck with it......but, someone will, and that will be the last Cadillac the will buy.



All good advice, as you might be able to make up your purchase price now.

However, I'd advocate against keeping the new '16 for any amount of time. I'd imagine the depreciation really hits once you cross 100 miles as opposed to reselling an essentially brand new car. Add to that the fact you know the Cadillac dealers may or or more than likely may not honor the warranty terms, the loaner car terms, or any other part of your contract based on how they feel that particular day, you are better off getting rid of the car ASAP. The last repair on my Neon was completed the day before it was disposed of in a quick sale, and yes, I was worried it might break down just taking it to where it needed to be sold (one trip and one day is too long in my opinion). Drive it STRAIGHT to where you will sell it. Advertise the sale if you are doing private party sale starting right now if you intend to do the deal with Caddy. Why run into a situation again where you need warranty service and are stuck with the rental car bill yet again?

The self-selection bias is a part of any survey, not just CR. Nobody can compel anybody to fill a form. I somehow find it hard to believe that if you own brand X AND subscribe to CR you'll have a negative bias, whereas if you own brand Y AND subcribe to CR, you'll respond with positive bias. Those self-selection aspects, both positive and negative, should wash for similarly performing models/brands. In other words, we should have statistically similar number of whiners and boosters owning Toyotas, BMW, Benz and Chevys, thus statistically significant differences between reliability of each brand should still transpire through that. Unless you truly believe that somehow Benz, VW and GM owners subscribing CR are somehow at war with their manufacturers for no reason, whereas Toyota's, Honda's, and Subaru's owners, subscribing CR are paid shills.

You guys all bring up good points. I don't know what happened to the first car. Not sure how this whole swap one car for another car works, either. I just spoke to Cadillac Customer Service again, too. I'm not certain they actually know how this is supposed to go, either. Neither does the dealer, although they said they've done them before but each case is different. Dealer said most likely, they'll give me what I paid for the car, including taxes and fees. And, they apply that amount to another CTS. But, I bought my CTS cheap. I don't think those kind of deals are happening, currently.

I told Cadillac that the deal, as I understood it originally, was for them to give me a like for like car (same model, options, etc) and I give them mine...easy-peasy!

We'll see.
Sounds like they are doing the home mortgage SOP method on you. Everytime I've applied for a home loan mortgage, and granted it's only 3 times so far, I've been bamboozled into paying a few hundred to many hundreds more for my supposed ""rate"" than what was originally promised or quoted or estimated. It's like a magical bunny always makes the rate hike go in only one direction as soon as you ask for a rate lock.

I'm currently dealing with a bank on my new home mortgage and what they promised became a $1,130 up-charge for the rate. Since their lender fee is $895 they said how about we just give you the $895 back and call it a day after I complained. I get the impression I'm just being squeezed for more money ($227 this time around) until I abandon ship and go with another bank late in the game (would have to close very fast). I think GM might be doing the same to you in trying to figure out how much they can squeeze out of you in this proposed ""trade."" I know of no other industry as criminal as the banks and mortgage loan industry. In other businesses, a quote is a quote. Seems to me all the regulations and truth in lending disclosures are worth less than an overpriced USPS 49 cent stamp.

Couldn't have said it better myself! Great job. The tin foil hat wearing CR conspiracy theorists always make excuses that just don't stand up to any reasonable inspection.

People that hate Chrysler and subscribe to CR (I did last year at least through a Christmas gift) don't still own Chrysler's and disparage them in the magazine. Why inflict the self-torture just to give bad reviews? We've moved onto Honda's and Audi's, and even though I failed to fill out my survey, it would have only confirmed Audi's successes.

By the way, word from mechanic is that not all 4 pads have sensors, and the one that grinded into the rotor metal on metal was one without a sensor. The one with the sensor was about to go off, but hadn't yet, and of course the pads wore unevenly due to not being designed for heavy track use.

I owned a 2013 F150 Supercrew with the 5.0L V8 for the last 2 years, so I am quite familiar with it. I have driven trucks with the 3.5L ecoboost on more than one occasion, so I’m familiar with that engine as well. This time around, I drove a 3.5L and a 2.7L back to back. The 2.7L felt faster, quicker, more responsive to my “butt-o-meter”.

From the article you linked to, testing the 5.0L :

The lighter weight also helps the F-150 accelerate to 60 mph in a respectable 6.9 seconds. The 2.7-liter and 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine SuperCrew models we tested were between a half and a full second quicker, respectively.
Both of the turbo charged V6 engines are quicker and get better gas mileage than the V8. And the 2.7L twin turbo “feels” even faster / quicker than the larger, more powerful 3.5L. What’s not to like?

On the downside, I have stated before that the longevity of this brand new twin turbo engine is somewhat of a question in my mind. If I were to keep the truck past the basic warranty (unlikely, as a card carrying member of CCBA), then I will buy an extended factory warranty.

How often do you have to punch your CCBA membership card to remain a basic member?

3381,October 2015,dino001,"Bottom line, CR confirms what I always knew - there is a price downsizing. Nothing comes free. You can't have low displacement, low price, high power, high mileage, AND high reliability. When you stress things closer to their end points (higher pressures in turbocharged, direct injected engines), you will suffer somewhere. Add complexity of the design and it not only breaks more often, it is also more expensive to fix.

I think cars are much better and much more reliable than they were in 70s and 80s. However, I'm not so sure if they are more reliable than those made in '90s and early '00s.

We still have it OK. Europeans got really screwed by their representatives. Between those diesel mandates, insane 1.2, 1.4 tripple turbos with 150 horsepower, they are in world of hurt when it comes to reliability.

The one thing I simply don't understand having been in the booze business is this, and maybe Michaell can educate me based on the experience is his state: people say that there is a tax revenue windfall to be had by legalization. But there are few barriers to entry for producing it, unlike booze. It doesn't need to be aged for years, you don't need lots of processing and bottling equipment, etc. So why would people pay the (presumably) higher price to buy the legal, taxed stuff when they could just keep getting it tax-free from whomever sells it to them now? I assume it would have to be cheaper. Is the supposed revenue windfall coming from increased use by those who would not otherwise? Everything I've read says that doesn't happen, so I'm at a loss.

Like I said, I'm really struggling with this one. It is very troubling to me.
In many places where marijuana is legal there is a thriving illegal marijuana market. As you said there is basically few barriers to entry and with the restrictions and regulations involved with legally growing the stuff it is cheaper to grow it illegally. That and the fact that it isn't taxed makes the illegal stuff cheaper to the consumer and more profitable for the seller.

Southbound through Dayton's construction is mostly on the new concrete pavement with 3 open lanes. A little rough at the south end of downtown where the pavement transitions over some of the old pavements to the finished road just south of it. I calculate you're driving from home and will get there around middle afternoon and south should be normal traffic with increased density south of the construction area but that's normal 3 lanes that's been there. Remember that the 3-4-5 lanes from Dayton to Cincinnati is all 65 mph and not the 70 mph that many try to make it. The OSP has been fairly active on that strip near Austin landing (42) and Springboro (38) about 10 miles south of downtown Dayton. They love BMW's and Audi's along with middle-aged women driving SUV's above the limit.

Cincinnati has orange barrels out for you midway to downtown, Norwood Lateral and Mitchell Avenue area (Milepost 9-8) . That's north of where the construction was last year when the Hopple overpass fell onto the roadway below after you had passed through. Construction continues in the area near downtown where that overpass fell last year, but I believe it's much better than last year. I was through there about 7 weeks ago going to a couple of car shows.

If I live long enough, one day I'd like to drive through Dayton and Cincinnati on our way south without any orange barrels. I can't recall when there wasn't construction in one place or the other.

Went to the dealership last night (not the orginal selling dealership). Apparently, the one closest to me had a complete management change, with the old managers going to another store for the owner (big dealership group) and bringing in the Porsche GM from up north. Met him. Nice guy. Told him of my trials. He was apologetic and said the service manager had gone to their Kia store (good place for him) and they have a new service manager that came from a Benz store in IL. So, this should be interesting. He has only been on the job for 3 weeks, but Cadillac told me to contact him directly.

The way this is supposed to work is I walk away from my car, no fees for mileage, or wear/tear. I just walk away. Then, I pick a car that is similarly equipped, and they sign the title for it over to me. That's it. Sounds too easy....especially given what I've been through so far.

So, lots of questions that I still don't have answered that the SM is supposed to find out. First, all reabates are supposed to come to me. Does that mean they write me a check? Or, does that mean they deduct them from the price of the car? Do I get to pick any CTS I want or order one? Or, do I have to ""settle"" for what they have on the lot?

Speaking of what they have on the lot, there were a couple that interested me.

GG, I was just reading this article about CR reliability survey. It seems the 8 and 9 speed transmissions are a source for problems....and Cadillac is mentioned.



DETROIT — Elaborate new transmissions are helping automakers meet rising fuel economy standards, but they're also requiring more trips to the repair shop.

Transmission problems tripped up Honda, Nissan, Jeep and other brands in Consumer Reports' annual reliability survey. Drivers reported rough shifting, clutch failure and even transmissions that had to be replaced twice in the first year of car ownership.

Lexus and Toyota — which rely on older transmissions in many of their models — were the best-performing brands in the survey. Lexus or Toyota has topped the survey since 2011. Audi, Mazda and Subaru rounded out the top five. The worst performers were Infiniti, Cadillac, Ram, Jeep and Fiat among 28 brands.

The survey predicts the reliability of 2016 cars and trucks based on a survey of its subscribers. This year's survey was based on responses from owners of 740,000 vehicles. Consumer Reports' annual survey is closely watched by the auto industry, since many potential buyers follow the company's recommendations.

Wall Street watches closely, too. Tesla Motors' shares fell almost seven per cent after Consumer Reports said it would no longer recommend its Model S sedan. The Model S got high scores in the magazine's driving tests, but owners reported multiple mechanical problems.

Transmissions with more gears help engines run more efficiently. A car with an eight-speed transmission gets about eight per cent better fuel economy than one with a four-speed, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Dual-clutch transmissions use separate clutches for odd and even gears, allowing faster shifting. And continuously variable transmissions do away with fixed gears altogether, relying instead on a system of pulleys to produce an infinite variety of engine to wheel-speed combinations.

But new technology can cause problems. Honda Motor Co. took a risk and put two new transmissions — an eight-speed dual-clutch and a nine-speed — in its 2015 Acura TLX sedan. Consumer Reports said they had multiple problems, and the Acura brand slipped seven spots to 18th in this year's survey. The Honda brand remains in the top 10, but it fell below Kia for the first time due to transmission problems as well as glitches with its infotainment system.

Jeep, too, remained at the bottom of the survey because of problems with the nine-speed transmission in its new Cherokee SUV, which is made by the same company that supplies Acura. And continuously variable transmissions caused problems for Nissan and its luxury sibling, Infiniti.

Automakers often let buyers choose their engine and transmission combinations, so buyers can avoid problems by opting for the older, more tested transmission, says Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports' director of auto testing. Brands that have consistently high reliability scores will also tend to have better transmissions. Toyota has had few problems with the continuously variable transmission it introduced on the 2014 Corolla, for example.

""It often comes down to the manufacturer,"" Fisher said. ""If Lexus starts unrolling eight-speed automatics, they're going to be fine.""

Ford was the survey's biggest gainer this year. Fisher said Ford ironed out problems with transmissions and infotainment problems that surfaced several years ago when the automaker introduced a raft of new vehicles. Volkswagen and Hyundai also improved as their models aged.

General Motors Co. had a mixed record. Its Buick brand is among the most reliable, but Cadillac fell seven spots to 25th because of problems with its dashboard infotainment system.

Tesla wasn't ranked because it only has one product, the Model S sedan. But Fisher said responses from 1,400 Tesla owners indicated that Tesla has below-average reliability. Owners reported sunroof leaks and problems with the electric motor and the dashboard screen, among other issues.

Their data always seems to reflect real-world experiences and word of mouth. There is no hogwash in their numbers. Anyone who doubts manufacturer's don't use ""ringers"" with other publications that don't randomly purchase their tested vehicles is extremely naive.

And, they apply that amount to another CTS. But, I bought my CTS cheap. I don't think those kind of deals are happening, currently.

What does the term ""oil and filter change"" mean?

What does ""check tire tread depth"" mean? Are tires filled with water and the depth of the water is important to know?

From some of your postings on CCBA & the Diesel thread, it seems like you are really happy with your truck. Did you even drive the V8 or just the 2.7?
I owned a 2013 F150 Supercrew with the 5.0L V8 for the last 2 years, so I am quite familiar with it. I have driven trucks with the 3.5L ecoboost on more than one occasion, so I’m familiar with that engine as well. This time around, I drove a 3.5L and a 2.7L back to back. The 2.7L felt faster, quicker, more responsive to my “butt-o-meter”.

From the article you linked to, testing the 5.0L :

The lighter weight also helps the F-150 accelerate to 60 mph in a respectable 6.9 seconds. The 2.7-liter and 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine SuperCrew models we tested were between a half and a full second quicker, respectively.
Both of the turbo charged V6 engines are quicker and get better gas mileage than the V8. And the 2.7L twin turbo “feels” even faster / quicker than the larger, more powerful 3.5L. What’s not to like?

On the downside, I have stated before that the longevity of this brand new twin turbo engine is somewhat of a question in my mind. If I were to keep the truck past the basic warranty (unlikely, as a card carrying member of CCBA), then I will buy an extended factory warranty.

Is this political or not? The original post definitely was, so I did not respond (despite being 100% opposed to the point of view expressed).

I’m going to say (arbitrarily) that this is not political, this is scientific / medical / moral (alcohol versus marijuana). My opinion, and my opinion only: Yes, alcohol and marijuana are NOT the same. Alcohol is much worse. Much, much worse. The great majority of people that I have known in my life have been drinkers. 80% of them, never drink to excess. A few drink to excess occasionally. And a smaller number, maybe 5 to 10%, are alcoholics. Their lives have been ruined by alcohol. Ruined, devastated, destroyed – pick your word, the same outcome.

I have known over the course of my life a great many people who used marijuana. Not as many as drank alcohol, but still quite a large number of people. There was a period of time when I was in college (69 to 72), probably 90% of the people I knew (including the professors) were dabbling, at the very least. And not one single person that I know or have known has had his/her life destroyed by marijuana.

Granted, some had their lives destroyed by the legal system, the laws against marijuana. But that’s another good reason to legalize, not prohibit.

I just did a quick search and found this:

Problem drinking that becomes severe is given the medical diagnosis of “alcohol use disorder” or AUD. Approximately 7.2 percent or 17 million adults in the United States ages 18 and older had an AUD in 2012. This includes 11.2 million men and 5.7 million women. Adolescents can be diagnosed with an AUD as well, and in 2012, an estimated 855,000 adolescents ages 12–17 had an AUD.
This, above, is in my opinion a heck of a lot worse than marijuana.


Having family member who struggles with alcohol abuse I agree that it is a dangerous drug but making more different drugs available seems like saying machine guns are dangerous so let's give everybody a pistol.

The previous generation Tremor models had the 3.5 with a 4.10 rear end. They could hit 60 in a couple tenths over 5 seconds.
The 2.7L models come with a 3.31 rear axle. It's difficult to find one that doesn't have that rear end. My dealer had about 8 XLT F150 crew cabs, all with the 302A equipment package, the same rear end, the same MSRP on the window sticker. ""What color do you want?"" (smile)

He only one had one XLT crew cab with the 3.5L, and it had a 3.15 rear end. If you start shopping online, looking at the window stickers, you will see nearly all 3.5L trucks have the 3.15 rear end.

He had about a dozen 5.0L models in stock (XLT, crew cab), and there was quite a variety of rear end ratio available there.

These results are what I found here in Houston, TX, looking at online inventory from several different Ford dealers. F150, XLT, crew cab, 301A or 302A packages.

When I was shopping Chevy Silverados, I had a heck of a time finding one that didn't have the blankety-blank 3.08 rear end, which I really, really didn't want.

You've got to be kidding!  Driver, even though this is the first maintenance service I have experienced in the last 10 years on a car that I've owned, I am 71 years old and have been driving since I was 17.  I have had many, many, many, many services done on cars I've owned or leased.  My post was supposed to be tongue-in-cheek, but I guess it buzzed right over your head.  Sorry about that - I need to consider my audience more carefully when posting!  

stever: lol about the 2 months to get wheels fixed.

imid: I don't know about a massage but my dealer has a spa, nails, facial, massage etc. - not for me. Oh, and a golf simulator and movie theatre.

3444,October 2015,graphicguy,"Thanks, all! I really do appreciate you guys listening to me ""whine, moan and complain"". GM/Cadillac have this down to a science. They know how this goes. It took the electrical system in my Mother's STS to fry everything in the car (including blowing out the back window from a surge through the rear window defroster) for them to finally buy back her car. But, it wasn't mine. I could afford to wait as long as necessary given neither she, nor I had to drive the car.

You guys are right. I went to the local dealership last night. They have quite a few '16s already on the lot, which was surprising.

All I have so far is an email stating what they are thinking. That is (paraphrasing), they get my car back. I pick one similar out from dealer stock. We swap and all go on our merry way, no money coming out of my pocket. That last part bothers me a bit, given I've been driving a car that's been defective for nearly a year. The other part, I want nothing to do with the original selling dealer. Can't put my finger on it, but there's something not quite right about the cars they purport to be new, or how they regularly seem to have mistakes on their paperwork

Now, the real question is, will they follow through. I gave the Cadillac Customer Service manager the vin # of the car I liked. They already have the vin# of my current car. What happens now, I really don't know. The dealer said they've done corporate swaps before, but usually, they're all different from each other. He did say that Cadillac only reimburses them a nominal amount for taking a car out of their inventory at ""no profit"". He also said since technically my car isn't a buy back, it will end up out of the region for sale as a used car with clear title. So, someone's getting an issue plagued car, that's really still under warranty.

I'll let you know how this plays out.

Again, thanks!

BTW Driver, after last night's election results I may need to relocate south. Any advice appreciated. I fear for Canada.

I feel the same was you do ab.....I feel like moving to a place where the party that promises the most goodies and will go into debt to do it is now in power.

btw...we have a Liberal government in Ontario, and we have the worse debt than any jurisdiction in North America....worse than California at the peak of their problems (per capita).

However, the thing to keep in mind is the federal government probably won't change as much as it sounds like it says it will. For the most part life goes on and what the federal government does doesn't affect us too much. So we have a young kid as PM, who's only real job was teaching drama for a year....we will become the laughing stock on the world stage.

I suggest keeping the VIN on the first and the current CTS and checking them on Ohio's title website to see where the car shows up. I've also had luck checking the VIN in google to see if the VIN had been captured going through a dealer lot inventory or through an auction when others were looking at a specific vehicle.

I wonder what happened to the first car they traded you out of?

3452,October 2015,abacomike,"On Saturday night, I got home very late - was out dancing and dining with a lady-friend (not a SO).  I tried pulling into my parking space, but a Fiat 500 was parked dead center on the parking stripe leaving me no room to pull in.  So I parked in a guest spot overnight.  The owner of the Fiat just bought an apartment on the first floor so on Sunday morning at 11:00 AM, I ring her doorbell.  No answer!  So I knock on the door - still no answer.  So I ""BANG"" on the door - again, still no answer.  Her car was still blocking my assigned spot, so I figured she was indisposed.

I placed a note under her windshield wiper asking her to please park in her own spot, not halfway into my spot.

I get home Sunday evening, and now her car is parked ""in my spot"", all the way.  So I again knock/bang on her door - no answer.  I figured I've tried to be nice about this, but nice was not working out for me to get this resolved.

So I call security and they come over to survey the situation.  Security tells me she is a new owner and may not know which parking space is her reserved spot.  The knock on the door but got the same result. But they had her phone number and called her.  She then came outside and security informed her of her correct parking space. She said she is hard of hearing and did not hear the doorbell or the knocking and banging on her door.  She apologized to me after security walked her over to her spot (obviously vacant as she was occupying my spot.  She moved her car into her spot, but she was parked right on the parking stripe, leaving me insufficient space to correctly park my car.

Security asked her to park in the center of her assigned spot, not on the left line marker.  She tried 3 times, but was unable to pard straight or within the boundaries of her parking space.  Security asked her if she was able to see well enough to drive.  She responded that she was blind in her left eye and her right eye was not so good.

When I got home this morning from shopping, once again she had parked in between both parking spots.  That was the last straw!

I called the police and when they arrived with our own security personnel, security briefed the police on what she had said yesterday and the fact that she keeps parking diagonally or in my spot.

The police got her to come out - questioned her about her sight - and after she stated she was blind in one eye and didn't see too well with the other eye, they confiscated her driver's license until she could pass a driving vision test.  She was very upset - but the police stated to her that if she presented a hazard driving a vehicle, they were obligated to withhold privileges to drive until she could prove she was not severely handicapped by her vision.

I received a call from her son an hour ago cursing me out for causing his mother all this aggravation.  I merely said to him that I have a right to park in my spot and if he didn't like it, tell it to the cops and security and then hung up.

Is this political or not? The original post definitely was, so I did not respond (despite being 100% opposed to the point of view expressed).

I’m going to say (arbitrarily) that this is not political, this is scientific / medical / moral (alcohol versus marijuana). My opinion, and my opinion only: Yes, alcohol and marijuana are NOT the same. Alcohol is much worse. Much, much worse. The great majority of people that I have known in my life have been drinkers. 80% of them, never drink to excess. A few drink to excess occasionally. And a smaller number, maybe 5 to 10%, are alcoholics. Their lives have been ruined by alcohol. Ruined, devastated, destroyed – pick your word, the same outcome.

I have known over the course of my life a great many people who used marijuana. Not as many as drank alcohol, but still quite a large number of people. There was a period of time when I was in college (69 to 72), probably 90% of the people I knew (including the professors) were dabbling, at the very least. And not one single person that I know or have known has had his/her life destroyed by marijuana.

Granted, some had their lives destroyed by the legal system, the laws against marijuana. But that’s another good reason to legalize, not prohibit.

I just did a quick search and found this:

Problem drinking that becomes severe is given the medical diagnosis of “alcohol use disorder” or AUD. Approximately 7.2 percent or 17 million adults in the United States ages 18 and older had an AUD in 2012. This includes 11.2 million men and 5.7 million women. Adolescents can be diagnosed with an AUD as well, and in 2012, an estimated 855,000 adolescents ages 12–17 had an AUD.
This, above, is in my opinion a heck of a lot worse than marijuana.

3462,October 2015,ab348,"It sounds like I'm just a few years younger than you and I don't disagree with your observations all that much. I would argue, though, that the fact that it was illegal - despite it being used by a sizable number of people - kept its use in check. You could walk down the street with a case of beer no problem. You couldn't do that with a sack of weed. If you used it, for the most part considerable discretion was needed and it was private. Now here, that will go away. Presumably there will be signage, promotion and advertising, and if it is sold in liquor stores as some people assume, there it will be right alongside the case of beer with what I assume will be an attractive point of sale display. That alone, it seems to me, will make the use much more prevalent and lead to many more problems as it becomes as accessible as booze and is placed on more or less a level playing field. Certainly in my younger years I knew a number of people who went off the rails as a result of drugs and they all began with marijuana. Now I know that the gateway drug argument is hotly disputed but that is just what I saw. It wasn't the marijuana that did them in in the end but it was always there. Today I would worry more about the effects of mixing booze and weed as many people do, which seems to multiply the effects of both to a dangerous extent especially on the roads.

But my main issue is that I just don't like the stuff. I went through a phase when I was younger when, as you say, I dabbled in it. That's a good way to describe it. I didn't like what it did to me and those around me, how it made everyone stupid, didn't like the nudge-nudge-wink-wink attitude that accompanied it, didn't like the people involved in it, and hated the fact that it was smoked with its resulting smell, mess, and look. I will hate to see that becoming accepted and open in society. Unlike alcohol, it doesn't quench your thirst after mowing the lawn, doesn't compliment a meal like a nice wine, it only exists for delivering the high. I know some percentage of people with a problem treat alcohol that way, but isn't that the only use for marijuana (aside from the relatively few medical uses)? So maybe that's my moral issue. I freely admit that sometimes the booze business is really good at looking the other way on that part of its effects. We always tried to emphasize the high-end part of our business but we also sold a lot of Colt 45. The booze business is a crappy business in some ways, but I see the marijuana business as being just as bad if not worse because everyone you're dealing with was a criminal until the day it became legal. At least the booze business has had 85 years to shed that part of its background.

The one thing I simply don't understand having been in the booze business is this, and maybe Michaell can educate me based on the experience is his state: people say that there is a tax revenue windfall to be had by legalization. But there are few barriers to entry for producing it, unlike booze. It doesn't need to be aged for years, you don't need lots of processing and bottling equipment, etc. So why would people pay the (presumably) higher price to buy the legal, taxed stuff when they could just keep getting it tax-free from whomever sells it to them now? I assume it would have to be cheaper. Is the supposed revenue windfall coming from increased use by those who would not otherwise? Everything I've read says that doesn't happen, so I'm at a loss.

Like I said, I'm really struggling with this one. It is very troubling to me.

We had a terrible tragedy here late on Saturday night/Sunday morning when 4 young (19-22 y-o) people, 2 guys and 2 girls, in a fairly new Civic coupe, were in a single-car wreck around 1:30AM on a 2-lane highway. The car left the road, went into a ditch, apparently hit a culvert, flipped, and then continued for several hundred feet. The two girls were ejected and died, another person is in critical condition. Amazingly, the driver was OK and released from hospital. Police said immediately that alcohol was involved, but the suspicion, given the ages, is apparently that other substances were as well. Of course it takes time for those results to be determined via tests.

Then there is where I-90 and I-94 merge heading into the city of Chicago, if you're inbound on either one and want to that the other outbound at the merge you have to get off the interstate and make your way to the outbound interstate.

Why don't they call it paddle ball?
There is a similar game called paddle tennis or paddle ball. Also played on a smaller tennis court, with paddles, played with a tennis ball that has lost most of it's bounce. Pickleball seems to require less running, and needs less space. In Florida it is almost always played outdoors....up here in Canada it is played indoors 90% of the time. It is played on a court about the size of a volley ball court, so those courts can easily and be temporarily changed from one to the other.

It depends on what you are trying to do. I train in MMA. It is a great workout while actually learning things, which is important to me because I get bored very quickly performing pointless exercise. The learning aspect keeps me coming back. I have no illusions, however, of ever competing. I'm way too old, nonviolent, and noncompetitive. And that is the case with everyone I train with. We even had a couple in their late 60s join us a couple of nights ago. I guess the question is whether it is still a ""sport"" if you don't compete. I would argue that it is lest you exclude individual runners, hunters, fisherman, etc.
May I ask is it a MMA class that is taught by actual trainers that know what they are doing or is it by physical trainers that got a certification? The reason I ask is that I am big in bicycling and I do training on a stationary bike when I cannot be outside. I would say that 99% of spin instructors don't really know what they are doing.

Yes, you may ask. I work with 4 different instructors. One is an ex-pro, trains some current pros, has trained olympians, and trained in 9 different styles in 7 countries. He is the real deal,and that is the only one I would classify as an ""MMA class."" Another (the owner of our dojo) is a 5th-degree Shotokan black belt and certified in Krav Maga. He has also competed in a number of karate and kickboxing tournaments around the country. The other 2 lesser instructors are 2nd- and 3rd-degree Shotokan black belts. With the latter 2, I sometimes feel like they learn as much from me as I do them, but its still a good workout.

And I know what you mean. Luckily, we ran into the right people early on and learned very quickly to avoid the ""cardio kickboxing"" classes that permeate most typical gyms. If it is something that interests you (or anyone else reading), the actual UFC-branded gyms typically employ trainers who compete or are working toward competing. I was a member there for a little while because we followed the first instructor in my paragraph above there, but he didn't stick around and went private, so we left as well. It was quite far from home for us anyway. The other guys there were OK, just not up to his level.

If you're concerned with punishing Cadillac, the experience has certainly cost them in the form of parts, labor, and now taking possession of a faulty car and providing a new car two years newer in return. This won't be cheap for them. Sure, it could possibly be a bit more costly if you're willing to invest in an attorney and take a chance that you'll win in the end. Hardly seems worth it, though. Only you can determine the cost/benefit that's worth it for you, but if you want opinions, it seems the majority think it's best to conclude the ordeal now. I wish you the best.

It's not that you feel you've been worn down by GM/Cadillac/Service/Dealerships, it's gotten to the point where you are just FED UP!  Take a new 2016 CTS with the high output engine just like you originally bought.  But I would not sell it right away.

Once it's titled, it becomes a used car and is worth the same as a 2016 with 3000 or 4000 miles on it.  Drive the car for a few months.  By then, you might even enjoy the car.  I am sure Cadillac has ""fixed"" the problem(s) you had with yours in the 2016 model.  You loved the car until the problems arose.

I am merely advising you - I would do exactly what I am recommending here.  If after 2-3 months you don't want or like the car, for whatever reason(s), go shopping until you find what you'd like to drive and trade the 2016 CTS.

Global warming is a political myth for control. We've been in a period now where the earth has not warmed for 12 or 14 years. So the believers call it a ""pause."" When a hypothesis has to be explained by changing data and manipulating data and giving all kinds of excuses for why global warming has taken a vacation, scientifically that hypothesis is in trouble. I believe after the exposure of data fiddling to invent the hockey stick change in slope of the graph, they changed the name to ""climate change"" so cold winters could be proof of warming. Huh?

I recall the Jimmy Carter era where we were afraid we'd all be wearing bearskin caps and fur coats to try to keep warm--and that's in Florida!!! LOL. Coming Ice Age, and it wasn't the movie they were talking about.

A few articles I found pretty much note the following are the biggest growth sports:

adventure racing aka Spartan Races, Tough Mudders, et al
MMA
triatholons - on and off road
lacrosse
rugby.

The first and third could probably be done by seniors who have been physically active over the years. I can see the beauty of pickleball - slower game that can be played by those that may not have been physically active over the years.
The things on that list are all just ridiculous. The closest thing to a ""sport"" there is lacrosse and that is like combining the worst aspects of soccer (constant running around) and hockey (getting hit by projectiles moving at high speed). The rest are painful, dangerous, risky displays for hardcore zealots IMO. While I find it hard to get behind a sport that calls itself ""pickleball"" (could they have found a worse name?) at least it probably won't put you in the hospital or worse.

I think we need more stuff like badminton or lawn bowling.

He said if the BBB arbitraitor does not authorize a buy back (difficult to do without driving the car to see the problems I have been having) and puts me off another couple of months, its tough to see if I would prevail or not. He said he normally negottiates a new car...not a buy back.

That said, Cadillac seems like they don't want to go to arbitration, even if they rarely lose.

Cadillac sent me the differences between the '14 CTS and the '16. I guess they totally redid CUE, put in an 8 speed trans vs the '14s 6 speed.

Mine was with the Mets in '72. As they say, speed kills.

Interesting aside on hard things to do in sports. I play golf (12 hdcp) and was also a very good bowler for a long time. We had a family friend who also did both who had multiple 300 games, and he said something that is very true.

Anyone can get lucky and roll a 300. Happens to people who average 150. But if you're an 18 hdcp golfer, you are NEVER going to shoot in the 70's. Just not gonna happen.
That is probably true, but I have also heard that it is possible for a really good amateur golfer to beat a good professional on a given day because in golf there is an element of luck. On the other hand I have heard that a really good amateur tennis player has no chance against a professional tennis player. Having played both games for years, I believe that to be true.

GG, this is a really good point.

Also, a 2016 is worth an extra $12 to $14K at least. I would drive it for awhile and see if you like it, it may be fine and you may love it as ab does his Caddie. If you don't like it you could trade and you would be pretty close in $s.

Good point was that it would have zero miles on it....not be a demo or something. And, most important:
THE WARRANTY BEGINS WHEN YOU PICK UP THE CAR. I have seen cases where this was part of your original warranty, so they consider this the fix, and you just have the remaining time on the original.

Then carve into the instrument panel on the one you have that it ""is a Lemon"", so no one else will get stuck with it......but, someone will, and that will be the last Cadillac the will buy.

Well, that may be part of it, but consider this.

In Halifax we have two long suspension bridges over the harbor. Both were built using bond financing, which has since been paid off. But they are tolled at $1 per crossing. generating about $30 million a year. That pays for maintenance and repair, patrol and safety, and capital improvements. Right now they are replacing the deck on the oldest (60 years) bridge, which is going to cost several hundred million, which is borrowed money. I don't have a problem with the toll. The operation seems reasonably well-run, and I don't see a whole lot of obvious waste except for an excess of retired military types wandering around the toll booths not doing much, and an occasional misguided and unnecessary speed trap campaign. You have to maintain these things and why not charge those who use it?

Here in IL the Tollway Authority has taken over the poorly planned and poorly named Elgin-O'Hare expressway. It's poorly named as it while you can take it going between Elgin and O'Hare Airport it goes to neither, it's poorly planned as it is not wide enough for rush hour traffic and the east ends at a stoplight a short block away from the interchange for I-290 (although it continues as Thorndale Ave.). Anyway the Toll Authority has taken it over and is currently widening it and is extending it into O'Hare Airport.

The list was made up from what people submitted, so it is made up of sports that are more mainstream. Some sports mentioned few would vote for because few have heard of them.

Golf is going through a rough time. Too expensive for a lot of people, and just takes too much time. Young people don't have the money or the time.

They are trying to revive the game though. Making huge 12 inch holes to speed up the game. There is frisbee golf. 12 hole course instead of 18. Ah, young people just want to play on their computers.

Perhaps in the Villages or Del Webb senior communities. There are other sports that have grown more in the past year than there are pickleball players worldwide.

A few articles I found pretty much note the following are the biggest growth sports:

adventure racing aka Spartan Races, Tough Mudders, et al
MMA
triatholons - on and off road
lacrosse
rugby.

The first and third could probably be done by seniors who have been physically active over the years. I can see the beauty of pickleball - slower game that can be played by those that may not have been physically active over the years."

"" “While the Environmental Protection Agency estimates the Jetta TDI at an economical 29 mpg city and 40 mpg highway, Volkswagen went a step further to show real world fuel economy of the Jetta TDI. Leading third-party certifier, AMCI, tested the Jetta TDI and found it performed 24 percent better in real world conditions, achieving 38 mpg in the city and 44 mpg on the highway.”

""And CR says it’s these better-than-sticker estimates that pushed many people to go out and buy a diesel model over their gasoline and hybrid counterparts.

""Consumer Reports also looked back at 16 diesel models they recently tested and found that only Volkswagen-branded diesel models exceeded the EPA-estimated MPG numbers. The signs have been there all along!""

Interesting...it sounds like it could cost $4000 to $5000 per VW to get it up to standards. The article said they could probably buy the cars back....say a 2009 Jetta TDI for $7000 each. I suppose they could buy them back and then sell them to China, India or Cuba...it might be less of a loss than fixing them.

I was reading an interesting article in Car and Driver (Nov/2015) on the booming auto industry in Mexico, and the economics involved. This list caught my interest:

current hourly wages for autoworkers, worldwide:


Mexico - $8.24

China -$4.10

India - $2.10
That gave me a great business idea. Open up a big garage just across the border in Mexico. Could even make it a vacation spot, you stay a few days while your car is repaired.

Bragging about how they fooled the EPA and the public doesn't say much about how guilty they feel about this fraud.  Assuming what you found out about VW is FACT, they deserve everything that the EPA and the public will be getting in terms of civil and hopefully criminal penalties.

houdini, Normally I don't watch baseball too often but I have been following the Jays, since they finished the season so strong.

In the last series they won against the Rangers. They lost first 2 games then won 3 in a row. In the final game they fell behind 3 to 2 on a weird play. the catcher was throwing the ball back to the pitcher, it caught the batters bat, and went rolling up the 3rd base line. The umpire waved his hands as if to call time out, all the Jays stopped playing....the Ranger player on 3rd ran home and the score was 3 to 2 for the Rangers.

The Jays came up to bat and the Rangers made 3 huge errors on the next 3 plays....one involved the 3rd baseman dropping a ball anyone including me could have caught. Jays had 2 runners left on base, and Then Jose Bautista hit a three-run homer in the seventh inning to the put the Blue Jays into the lead and won the game and the series 6 to 3.

In tonights game the Jays were ahead 3 to 0. The Jose Bautista their star hitter had a 3 and 2 count, and the last pitch which should have been a ball was called as a strike. Even Bautista was ready to walk to 1st, and couldn't believe the ump called it a strike...it went across wide and at about his ankles. Then they missed an easy fly ball when two guys went for it and each thought the other had it, and it was one base hit after another, and they ended up losing 6 to 3.

It is amazing how quickly a game can change on a few plays.

Well, it ain't over until it's over, Jays could come back and they have had an incredible year.

*Note ab....the Jays seem to do better when they are behind......they get fightin' mad like they did in game 5 against the Rangers.

bean, If the Jays can come back twice from being behind 2 games in this series, I think they will defy the odds (I wonder how many times that has been done...coming back after losing the first 2 games doesn't happen very often). But, baseball as with most sports, depends on skill, but, there is an element of luck - so we never know what will happen.

I have been watching these games and baseball players have a lot of skills. Even sliding into a base or home requires a lot of skill. Double plays and strategies to get a run in etc require so much skill.

WHAT ARE THE TEN HARDEST THINGS TO DO IN SPORTS?

I was surprised, but it does make sense.

#1 Hitting a baseball
Considering that a major-league pitch can reaches speeds more than 95 mph, hitters have only 0.4 seconds to find the ball, decide where the ball is going and swing the bat.

If you want to see the others and more of an explanation see:
10 Hardest things to do in sports!

Car related is #2
Race car driving
Skilled drivers encounter a host of problems, but rounding the corners of the track is equivalent to having three 300-pound linemen pushing you for three of the four hours it takes to conclude a race.
2017 MB E400 , 2015 MB GLK350, 2014 MB C250"
3592,October 2015,houdini1,"That is a great list. Since I have been playing amateur golf for over 50 years, it was interesting that #4 on the list was hitting a long straight drive. I agree with what Curtis Strange said when he was asked what was the hardest thing in sports to do. His answer was trying to do something that you were not trained to do.

I also agree with what Butch Harmon said about teaching someone to play golf later in life. He said you would never be a thoroughbred, and the best he could do was to make you a racing mule.

I was a good enough baseball player to get a try out with the Cardinals back in 1961 when I was 18. They were brutally honest and told me that I had some skills, but that they could teach someone everything he needed to become a successful professional baseball player, except 2 things, and that any prospect had to have at least one of them. You had to be very fast and/or have a great arm. I had neither.

When I engage my adaptive cruise control, it also activates adaptive steering as well.  In order for the car to steer itself, there must be lane markings/stripes on both sides of the lane.  The steering wheel moves by itself if the car gets too close to a lane marker.  It gently steers toward the center of the lane.  But if you take your hands off the steering wheel, a sensor knows the driver's hands are not on the steering wheel and alerts the driver with a red animated steering wheel with hands off and trmporarily disengages adaptive steering until the hands are replaced on the steering wheel.

It's only a matter of time brfore driving becomes totally automated.  If I approach a car or barrier to quickly and the computer senses an imminent collision, an audible alert is sounded and the brakes are applied with sufficient force to avoid the collision.

On my way back from northern Florida last week, I drove straight through without s stop.  After 3 hours, I got an animated and audible alert (attention assist) to pull off the road and take a rest.  There's an amazing amount of relevant technologies on these cars.  The car's cameras pick up pedestrians walking off a curb and entering the car's path - the car swerves to avoid the pedestrian.  Truly amazing safety technology.

I think that the solution is a combination of things, not just one.

To replace gas taxes I think we are heading towards a per mile road use tax (sort of like a toll).

They don't give you license plates, you have to buy them. They don't give you liability insurance, but you have to have it in order to take your car on the road (legally). The days of mandatory EZ-Pass are probably not far off, in my opinion. Here in the Houston area, trying to get around town without one is nigh on to impossible already.

As a certified, dues paying member of CCBA (Chronic Car Buyers Anonymous), the very first thing I do after buying a new car or truck is to get an EZ-Pass tag. The dealer tags are good for 2 months, the insurance company gives me 14 days to notify them about adding the new car to my insurance plan. But HCTRA (Harris County Toll Road Authority) has no leniency, no grace period, zip, zilch, nada, none.

No, I don't expect the public, or even me, to ""like"" the Koch brothers any more than George Soros or the other millionaires or billionaires that try to ""buy"" candidates or votes.  Money, unfortunately, dictates who will be elected, when they will be elected, and how they will be elected.  There is something wrong when a democracy depends on money to oil its machines.

As far as whether the Koch brothers get along with each other or not, what they and others like them do to spread their political agendas is criminal - but they won't serve time in the pokey for these crimes against society.

Well, that may be part of it, but consider this.

In Halifax we have two long suspension bridges over the harbor. Both were built using bond financing, which has since been paid off. But they are tolled at $1 per crossing. generating about $30 million a year. That pays for maintenance and repair, patrol and safety, and capital improvements. Right now they are replacing the deck on the oldest (60 years) bridge, which is going to cost several hundred million, which is borrowed money. I don't have a problem with the toll. The operation seems reasonably well-run, and I don't see a whole lot of obvious waste except for an excess of retired military types wandering around the toll booths not doing much, and an occasional misguided and unnecessary speed trap campaign. You have to maintain these things and why not charge those who use it?

My following post is NOT POLITICAL.  

Fox News Channel just devoted 1/2 hour interviewing Charles Koch (one of the most frequently maligned billionaires in this country along with his brother David), his very first network interview.  The most interesting part of the interview is when he was asked if he was a Libertarian - his response was that he is a ""classical"" liberal!  I almost fell out of my recliner!  But as he further explained the definition of a ""classical liberal,"" it actually made sense - striving to create an environment whereby every human being is provided with an opportunity to succeed - not by doling out hand-outs, but by consolidating available resources aimed at making available equal opportunities for all.

As one viewer tweeted, ""...he sure didn't appear to be the evil force depicted by most of the of the media pundits...""

The Koch brothers donate billions of dollars to medical research, cancer prevention, hospitals, college scholarships and fellowships, to name a few.  But they also donate $300 million dollars each year to local, State and National candidates for public office (mostly Republican), for which they are chastised for.  Never heard that same chastising of George Soros's donations of hundreds of millions of dollars to progressive candidates.  Wonder why?
I caught part of that interview and enjoyed it. I thought Koch came across as being a pretty reasonable guy.

Nobody is saying anything of substance anymore. These are all rehearsed and vetted speeches that are cleared by the people who gave them money.

The trick is to see what they eventually DO when elected, not what they SAY they will do. When you view it that way, 99% of all American politicians are actually centrists, and have been for decades and decades.

Start with the heaviest traveled, most abused roads. Keep the money generated by those roads for the upkeep of those roads and not use it for anything else. I've thought about this a lot for some of our local roads and just a handfull of ""collection points"" would certainly supplement road funds.

The tricks are getting the government to give something away (the transponders), keeping the money where it belongs (I may NOT be onto something here), and preventing the creation of ""toll blockers"" for drivers to get around things. (OK, I'm definitely NOT onto something here)
Transponders can still be used to track you. Just ask this guy:

Per wiki: ""Illinois Lottery proceeds currently benefit three major areas: 1) the state's Common School Fund (CSF), which helps finance K-12 public schools
I wonder if ""proceeds"" means the net from the lottery after payroll and payouts.

Also, I know every state funds their public schools in a different manner, but in Ohio when they promised that lottery profits would go to the public schools in order to get the referendum passed by the voters, what they actually did was they passed the proceeds to the schools but then reduced the amount of funding to the schools in a commensurate amount. So the schools got the same total, more or less. So the legislators of the time didn't lie, exactly, they just didn't tell the whole truth. Surprise!!!!

as to how to pay, the fairest way is a miles tax. With a weight surcharge. that way, you pay for what you use, and the heavy vehicles that wear out roads faster pay more.

simplest way is to have it come out of the general fund. Though of course, that just means it will get squeezed out like other important things that don't generate immediate votes!

You could also implement an annual tax. somehow tied into registrations. Just need to check mileage and send the bill. And of course, that still gives the feds room for pork, by rigging the charges to give benefits to big donors special interests those that deserve it.

When I went to Ponte Vedra last week, I purposely took the Turnpike to Ft. Pierce before going over to I-95.  The condition of I-95 is pathetic.  

Another option for raising funds to repair roads is to make all Interstates Toll Roads. We have no toll booths - everything is either electronic/digital or a camera picks up the license plate and bills the registered owner.  I paid $12.90 round trip on the Turnpike - 600+ miles.

Obviously it would require installation of Pass Readers and cameras as well as computerizing toll collections, but it would eliminate increases in gasoline taxes and would not require reading odometers.  

Just have the toll road authorities take over all interstates.

As one viewer tweeted, ""...he sure didn't appear to be the evil force depicted by most of the of the media pundits...""

The Koch brothers donate billions of dollars to medical research, cancer prevention, hospitals, college scholarships and fellowships, to name a few.  But they also donate $300 million dollars each year to local, State and National candidates for public office (mostly Republican), for which they are chastised for.

Americans have had long lasting habit of taking English words, changing their meaning and then expecting rest of the world follow. Word ""liberal"" is a prime example. In Europe it meant ""loving liberty"" for 200 years. It still does. Their political stance is to advocate both social and economic liberties, which put them in opposition to both traditional left and right wing parties. They would forge some tactical alliances with either side, depending on the country and situation.

Meanwhile in 50s American communists were in need for a new word, as that one was simply banned and unpallettable for people here, so they called themselves socialists. This of course pushed proper socialists and socialdemocrats (advocates for left-wing social reforms in non-violent and democratic process) to look for a new word and they found liberal, as somehow it was unoccupied in America. As those ""classic liberal"" ideas gathered popularity, they were in need for a word, as theirs was hijacked. Hence the libertarian. The translations across the Ocean are real headache for those who don't follow those meanders.

Nobody is trying to copyright the VW scandal. But if someone does the research to write a book about the scandal then they are entitled to copyright protection. Further, it's common practice in the entertainment industry to option a book very early in the process. Thus the producer holds the right to make a movie based on the book.

Bless my wife, but I wouldn't want her in that hearing for a variety of reasons.. Plus, why should she take a day off teaching for this?

They gave me an option of calling in. But, if they can't see, hear, feel the problems, I don't know how I can possibly hope there would be a positive outcome. I guess I could tell the arbitrator that the power steering was going out, that there were intermittent stalling issues, that there are suspension issues, that there are CUE issues. But, I guess Cadillac representative can simply say ""no code, no problem"" and my case goes up in smoke. In short, it's ""GM doing what GM does"".

So, what are you planning on doing?

Well...I'm trying to get them to reschedule the arbitration hearing (which is subject to a date Cadillac approves....funny, they didn't offer me the same courtesy).

But wait, it gets even better. I called Cadillac Consumer Affairs this a.m., which was recommended I do by a GM employee, no less.

Come to find out, my Cadillac is listed with them as having two previous owners prior to me. One, obviously the dealer. The other is an individual that they said they could not disclose. Put a call into the selling dealer. This smelled when they started switching around cars on me. And, what the dealer disclosed to the BMV certainly doesn't reflect that.

I think I'll mosey on over to my local BMV and see if they can get to the bottom of this. Could be something as simple as a data entry error. Or, maybe not.

Not sure it makes sense that the dealer would have to disclose a prior owner to the BMV. I mean, the BMV would know without someone telling them, I hope. My guess is, Cadillac possible sold the car before but the deal was unwound before title was processed. Just a guess.

When my Dad died on July 1st, his Social Security pension for June (deposited electronically on July 3rd) was taken back by the government - taken right out of his checking account.

2 weeks later, I got a letter from the SSA telling me that my father was owed his June pension since he died on July 1st.  I completed the forms and sent them back - 1/2 to be electronically deposited into my account and the other 1/2 to be sent to my brother in the form of a check.

4 weeks later, I called the 800 number for the SSA and was told all paperwork was received and was completed correctly.  But it could take until October to receive the funds.  I called at the end of September and was told it could take another few weeks.

I called again yesterday and was told that the funds were not distributed because it was considered a ""low priority"" by the SSA and that it could take several more months before the funds were released.  I asked to speak to a manager.  I was told a manager could do nothing for me because it was out of their hands and in the hands of Treasury which determines when pensions and federal bills are paid.  But she said that if I could get my congressman involved, things could get expedited.

Can you imagine that?  The government owes my Dad his June pension payment which they themselves took back out of his checking account and after over 3 months, downright refuses to release the funds because Treasury says it is not a high enough priority.

I took SS when I turned 62 and later realized that I would have to give back too much and withdrew my claim. Had them charge $15k to my credit card in June. Still waiting for the charge to show on my bill. All that credit tied up for months.

Meanwhile I get two letters from SS, one saying they can't withdraw my claim until I pay them the same $15k I already paid. The other saying they overpaid me and send them a check for $9k. Both letters dated the same day.

I've been calling a guy in the local office who promised to take care of it in a week. This was 6 weeks ago and now he dodges my calls.

To make matters worse I had a family emergency and had to charge $8k on the same card. If SS bills $15k now it will be over the card's limit and be rejected.

I have to wait until the October bill comes to see if I avoided disaster. Maybe I should send you your dad's share and deduct it from what I owe.

If they can get away with it they will. However, 98% of the time warranties will be the same...maybe with very slight differences....but we are not too argumentative, so we just go along with what the car companies do.

3711,October 2015,berri,"Speaking of dealing with Social Security, I read that anyone new to Medicare this year or anyone who doesn't get social security like some state or federal gov employees will get an over $50 increase per month for 2016 because under some not really understood law, when SS gets no COLA, evidently the Medicare cost increase for the year can't be charged to current SS recipients, so everyone else picks up the whole tab. Just another goofy gov rule I guess. You can't even begin to understand all this nonsense in Washington, other than Congress writing too many poorly written laws and the gov being way too lawyered up. Oh btw Aba - if the gov runs out of money before they process your check due to expiring authority, or if there is a gov shutdown, you'll likely be waiting even longer to get that money you're owed. In fact, one of the reasons you may be waiting already is because Treasury has to use these kind of things for cash flow right now to prevent the US gov from running out of money already since a relatively small number of representatives in Congress won't act timely on budget authorization and both parties refuse to compromise. Pathetic. You can kind of see why Boehner finally decided ""enough of this crap already""."
3712,October 2015,tyguy,"Piston slap is a noise that some engines make before they warm up as a result of the piston rocking slightly in the cylinder bore. When the piston warms and expands the noise typically goes away. It's been present on a number of different makes and prone engines can get louder with age as the rings and cylinder wear. I've never heard of an engine failure due to piston slap, but those early 2000s Subaru engines were more prone and Subaru replaced pistons if owners complained about the noise.

The biggest reliability issue Subaru has run into were head gaskets on the normally aspirated 2.5 liter 4-cylinder motors from 2000 to mid-2000 years. Subaru was pretty good about helping owners out after warranty expiration. Subaru redesigned the gaskets several times and modified their coolant to help the situation, but in the end, the gaskets didn't have enough support. That caused them to radically redesign the 4-cylinder motors in the next generation such that it would be near impossible for the coolant and oil to mix (would take major structural failure).

It's long been one of my dreams to, at some point, pick up a gently used, unmolested (assuming there is such a thing...) CTS-V of the '09-'14 vintage. The new one coming out, after an couple years in the market, would be even better. Reading your story over the past few months has sealed the deal that neither of those will happen. I'm truly sorry for the immense aggravation you have been put through.

Whoever would have figured that the safest bet within the Cadillac stable would be the Escalade due to the proven Tahoe/Suburban guts? I offer this as opinion, not fact. I realize stories like yours exist with every manufacturer but you have been run through the ringer at every turn, and the ""answers"" you've been given are nothing short of ridiculous. I've been treated better by a dealer when I had a new $9,995 '91 Ford Ranger at the age of 21, when expectations of customer service were nothing like they are today. And that was about as far away from a premium brand or model as you could get!

3718,October 2015,js06gv,"My last post got me thinking about the brand I've owned the most of in the 30 years I've been driving, which ended up being Ford. Fifty percent of my current fleet is Ford as well. Even so, I don't consider myself a ""Ford guy."" At one time in my life, I had four GM vehicles in the driveway. I don't rule out the possibility that I'll own another GM in the future; in fact I have several thousand dollars of GM points collecting dust. It would've been easy to spend them, but it just so happened that when shopping both for a performance car and a truck, I preferred a Mustang over a Camaro and an F-150 over a Silverado.

I guess my point is, I buy what I like and how I've been treated throughout the ownership experience will definitely factor into future purchases. Although it's been a popular opinion on internet forums for years, I didn't purchase Fords because they didn't take bailout money when other manufacturers did. I simply went for what I believed offered the best value based on my needs. I've also owned some Fords in the past that I didn't care for much a couple years into ownership and traded them out earlier than usual.

My F-150 and the two Mustangs we've owned all had some issues that were well known by Ford. The first Mustang had a solenoid problem with some of the transmission gears, and the second one was afflicted with a horrible brake squeal at low speeds. On the F-150, it developed the usual two problems that most do, a clunk in the steering rack and a driveshaft ""bump."" In a perfect world, Ford would have issued recalls for these but instead there were TSBs that one would have to know about in order to get them fixed. In my experience, that's no different than most if not all other manufacturers. With the amount of information available on the internet (factual or not), consumers who even notice issues such as mine will do the research by frequenting boards such as this one and bring them to the attention of the dealer. For the four problems mentioned above, I simply waved the TSBs I printed out at the dealer and all were resolved with no pushback, drama, or dancing around. This was also across 3 Ford dealers, as I've tried several of those local to me to compare. None of them blew my socks off, but all were competent, courteous and efficient. I also wasn't expecting Lexus or Cadillac levels of service, although at list prices of 38K and 43K for the Mustangs and 48K for the truck we're hardly talking chump change either. I just expected ""service"" and in my case, between the manufacturer and several dealers collectively knowing their product, that's exactly what I got.

Must be a BMW thing. Subaru Eyesight recognizes curvy roads and doesn't alarm when you cross a line, which is a nice feature. My only annoyance is when I hit construction that forces you over lines and the system activates, or when I come across the many cyclists in Fort Collins riding two-lane roads and I cross the center line to give them plenty of room. It's a very minor annoyance and I positively love the safety features. I won't buy another car without them.
Safety nannies are fine for you guys who trade cars before even a light bulb burns out but for people like me who run cars until they beg for the release of the crusher they just look like expensive repair bills.

I admit I like the rear camera in the Ford when I back out of the garage in the dark but lord help me if it ever breaks.

I wonder if WRX STI's make up a higher percentage of that 3% than their share of sales would presume? Maybe they are driven too fast and die an early death. However, it's not likely that ""really slow drivers"" get in less accidents, but many studies would lean to the observation that they are involved in MORE accidents by virtue of driving too slowly. However, that slowness might keep those accidents minor, and avoid totaling the vehicle.

GG: you'd be interested to know that I read a recent article that discusses Chrysler has resorted to providing new car buyers a $200 incentive to sign a waiver to the lemon laws, and agree to do arbitration with them with an arbitrator of their choice of course, should that customer be unable to resolve their issues with the dealer or Corporate Chrysler. They shove this into the mountain of other paperwork one must sign when purchasing a new vehicle these days. I would think you, along with many others here would find that $200 incentive to be far too little to give up such a valuable right to sue based on lemon laws.

Seems like Chrysler is planning on a lot of future lemons to try and pull this stunt.

He was coming down the street, and I was going in the opposite direction. He put down his window and I put down mine, and he said, Was I sure my car wasn't a diesel because it sounded like one...which was pretty funny.

I told him he should get his polluter off the road......that quietened him down a bit.

I heard thst Hollywood is already planning a movie on the VW scandal. They just love trashing any capitalist while being the most greedy business on the planet.

All direct engines have that clackety clackety dieselesque sound. Some manufacturers tend to mask it better. My understanding is the noise is due to the higher pressure the fuel is under - much closer to the fuel pressure of a diesel.
Exactly. The Mercedes V-6's (3.0 and 3.5) have that ticking sound that resembles the new quieter diesel engines. Mention of the similarity in engines (gas/diesel) was published in C&D, CR and even Edmunds back in 2012/2013. That same sound in a 1980 Olds or Ford or ""whatever"" would resemble a problem with ""lifters""! Today, it's just ""natural"" in the direct injection engines.
2018 Mercedes S450"
3757,October 2015,abacomike,"There was a lengthy article in my local newspaper this morning in the business section about today's technology in most new vehicles. The article cited government studies, the results of which statistically proved fewer accidents in vehicles equipped with ""active"" Lane Tracking and Blind Spot Monitors (the car is forced back into a lane through adaptive braking to avoid a collision with an oncoming car in the ""blind spot"" or movement out of a lane), adaptive cruise control with auto-braking, accident avoidance systems with active braking, etc. But the article cited a serious problem - not enough drivers in possession of these new technologies know how they work or how to use them!!!

The rest of the article examined the changes in the size of the average owner's manual - from 50-60 pages in the 1970's and 1980's to over 500 pages in many of today's new cars. The article further indicated that more training was necessary by automobile dealership personnel when a new car is sold with these safety features. But few, if any, dealerships do a competent job of training their customers.

Mercedes actually reduced their manuals from 2 thick ones to one with 250 pages. Most details about safety features and technologies are on the hard-drive of the vehicle and must be accessed through the NAV/GPS screen.

After reading the article, I began to think about 70-80 year old drivers buying a car equipped with these new features and having no idea what the features are or how to use them. It's one thing to have a car equipped nicely with these new technologies - it's quite another when you consider the fact that 50% of the owners of these equipped cars have no idea about their use or shut the safety features down because they don't want to be bothered.

I used my adaptive cruise control and active lane keeping and blind spot monitors on the round trip to see my brother last week and there were several times when these features helped me avoid some nasty situations, especially with trucks and speeding cars.

In conclusion, the article emphasized the need for not only equipping all vehicles with these advanced safety technologies, but also the need to properly and adequately train new car buyers on how to use them and what flashing dash lights or ""beeps"" mean when they enunciate. The article sure made a lot of sense.

To be fair, it may never become a movie. Entertainment companies option books early in their life in order to beat out other people. Leonardo DiCaprio optioned the rights to a book proposal by Jack Ewing. The book hasn't even been written.

Take the new Steve Jobs movie that just came out. The book came out in 2011 and Sony optioned it. Aaron Sorkin was named the screenwriter in May of 2012. It took over 3 years for a script and production."
3759,October 2015,suydam,"Don't sell the 70 year olds short! We are getting to the point now where most people understand technology and how to use it. I notice sales personnel now just show where the cruise control and such are located because they know most people are familiar with it. Where they do spend time is with the infotainment center because those differ so much. And other new safety stuff like Blind Spot or Lane Watch -- they explained that too. The more it becomes standardized the easier it will be.

Some companies like Honda give out shortcut manuals for frequently accessed items along with the humongous manual.

The Mercedes-Benz direct injection engines DO SOUND LIKE DIESELS!  They have since 2012.  Not as harsh a sound, but definitely not a quiet engine!  
Thanks to you and rob for explaining.......I wondered why the engine was fairly noisy in my E.

No matter what age you are, the rear camera and blind spot warning device doesn't need much training to use and operate.

I did suggest to my Mercedes dealership they would really develop very loyal customers if they had a 2 hour course a few times a week for new owners, just to acquaint them with the cars features. It is too much to learn when you pick up the car and more questions develop later. It would bond new car buyers to their dealership and they may meet some new people who are like minded.

Must be a BMW thing. Subaru Eyesight recognizes curvy roads and doesn't alarm when you cross a line, which is a nice feature. My only annoyance is when I hit construction that forces you over lines and the system activates, or when I come across the many cyclists in Fort Collins riding two-lane roads and I cross the center line to give them plenty of room. It's a very minor annoyance and I positively love the safety features. I won't buy another car without them.

So I quickly packed the car and drove straight through to my condo with no stops (just over 4 hours at 75 mph all the way).  When I got to my door, it had been already secured by security (they have keys to all condo units).  I had called them before I left to inform them I would be away for the week - they usually check the units in cases like that.

My guess is that it was checked but they left it unsecured - some new guy checked it Thursday.  Boy, I was beside myself.  Ruined my birthday, that's for sure.

I suppose if there's any good news, it's that the Impreza was the one hit. Tuesday the Impreza will go into a dent removal shop to work out the sheet metal damage as best as possible without body filler or painting, and then I'll do what I can to compound out most of the paint rub. There will still be a small scar where to base coat was abraded away, but if I keep the area glossy enough the light reflections will make it harder to see.

That's one of those cases where you try to do the right thing and it turns out to work against you. The new security guy checked the apartment...and then forgot to lock it.

It's like the business teacher said...if you want a letter to get to a destination quickly send it by regular mail. If you send it express or something the delivery guy will take special care of it and leave it on the instrument panel, or put it in a door panel to keep it safe....and he'll forget about it. If it is handled with the regular mail it will get there with the rest.

Sorry I'm a few days late to the car company pride & prejudices discussion. There was a time where I would have considered myself severely brand loyal (fanboy is the term used online I believe) and would ONLY consider vehicles produced by Honda, Acura, & BMW. On the other side I was severely prejudiced against American vehicles (specifically GM) and Toyota/Lexus. As I've grown up and become wiser (I'm 39 now) about cars anyway, I appreciate more cars and would absolutely consider buying a much broader spectrum of cars than I would have back when I joined edmunds back in the late 1990s.

Every car company has had way more than its fair share of problems, recalls, & TSBs. None of companies are perfect.

I hear this argument from time to time and I'm not buying it at all. The culture, expectations, and attitudes one might find at certain automaker's and corresponding dealerships I've found to be a complete 180 from other cultures, attitudes, and expectations I've found at other car dealerships and automaker's. My experiences with multiple other vehicles (now VW, Audi, & Honda) are a direct opposite kind of experience from that I incurred at Chrysler. Hearing GG's stories and saga with Cadillac it brings back unpleasant memories from dealing with companies like Dodge, AT&T, & Circuit City. Company's that have disappeared or would have disappeared without bailouts (AT&T excluded). I'm particularly bothered by AT&T purchasing Direct TV, as that puts Direct TV on my blacklist, and I have one less competitor to shop against cable.

No company is perfect, but that doesn't mean these companies play the same sport in the same ballpark!

Neat bridge, Driver. I don't recall seeing it before, so I'm glad you re-posted. Interesting design in that the engineers switched from pylon supports to a suspended bridge and then back to pylons. Looks like there was a practical reason for doing so in order to allow for large ship traffic below the suspension pieces. From the traffic on the bridge and below in the water it looks well used.

That's interesting Ty. I will have to look that up to see why it is part pylon, part suspension. The bridge had to be high enough to let cruise ships into Tampa Bay.

I think the pylons are used on the lower parts not critical for large ships, and the suspension part is used to make a wide alley for large ships. Then, there are six dolphins, which are designed to withstand the impact of an 87,000t ship surrounding the bridge's piers.

Unfortunately, super size cruise ships won't fit under the bridge. They are considering making a newer cruise ship terminal just south of St. Petes/Tampa....they won't need to have a bridge at all.
My understanding is that cable stay bridge sections can span longer distances. The open span for ships is 50% wider than the old bridge which had been hit by a ship. Hence the decision for a wider span and the technology to achieve that span."

A slight detour back to the burger/shake places, if I may.  On the subject of Steak & Shake - why do they have a wait staff?  It seems to me it would be better if you ordered at the counter and they called your number for pickup.  When I'm going for that type of meal, I don't want to have to leave a tip.  They have Steak & Shakes here in Texas, but I never go to them because of the tipping thing.  I guess just call me cheap.
You can order at the counter if you want. I've done it either way.

I can't remember when I last had a milkshake that was full sized from the large steel
mixing container and then part of it poured into the glass with the rest waiting in the
steel container like a bonus after I finished the part in the glass. 18 years maybe? At
a privately-owned restaurant in a small town near here. I could watch them pour the
Hersheys syrup out of the can into the shake as they mixed it on the back counter above
the ice cream dip area. This is all making me crave a real milk shake.

Now so many ""shakes"" are some soybean-based food product as a thickener with

What interested me is that they sold an unusual 1998 Buick Riviera for only $10k. It was unusual because it was evidently liquidated by GM itself during the bankruptcy from the company's private collection. It had a factory Northstar v8 instead of the 3.8 v6 and it had special paint which changed color depending on the angle.

The Baracuda was probably a faster car but I wonder if the Riviera might have been rarer and a better collector's investment considering the back story. I found this story on line and it seem to be a one of a kind.

Northstar-powered 1998 Buick Riviera prototype - Click above for high-res image gallery

As we approach the big SEMA show in Las Vegas next week, it's time to look back at a previous star of the show. Sometime back in the mid-80s the decision was made that Buick would abandon V8 engines and instead be the home of the V6. Even for top models like Riviera and Park Avenue, turbocharged and supercharged versions of the long-lived 3.8-liter V6 would serve propulsive duties. Needless to say, not everyone in the bowels of the Warren Tech Center agreed with this approach.

In 1998 a group of GM engineers felt the Riviera should be powered by no fewer than eight cylinders and knew full well it was possible. The Riv of that era shared its platform with other models like the Cadillac Eldorado and Oldsmobile Aurora, which of course were powered by the still contemporary Northstar V8. A single Northstar Riviera example was built as concept and trotted out at the 1998 SEMA Show.

Upper management did not agree with the premise and only a year later the whole Riviera program was euthanized. Somehow, that one V8 powered Riv survived and managed to get sold outside of GM on a salvage title. If the styling of that last Riviera doesn't give you convulsions, the car only has 10,200 miles on it and the Buy It Now price is $20K. The current bid of $3,550 hasn't yet hit the reserve so it's anyone's guess what this will go for – if it goes at all.

I never ate at Friendly's - never even sat down at a table.  Remember, I am going back 44 years ago.  Friendly's had a service window where you would walk up and place your order for take-out.

You are correct.  The Seasons 52 restaurant is definitely upscale.  The Restaurant Mall is where they are located along with 35 other restaurants including Capital Grille, and they are self standing buildings right next to each other.  The Mexican restaurant we at at Thursday is a block away.  The place we are going to tonight for our birthday is 1/2 a block away.  This is a new concept for putting fine dining restaurants right there in the same location.  They have a new Nordstroms right in the center.  They also have PF Changs and several very expensive restaurants owned by we'll know chefs from New York, Paris, New Orleans, Chicago, etc.

You really need to envision this mall with 35-40 fine dining restaurants with Bar & Grilles around the circumference of the mall.  It's a concept I've never seen or heard of before.  One-stop fine dining.  Great concept.

The taste preference for cherry Coke ( Diet?) goes back to my youth when the soda parlors would serve fountain drawn sodas with cherry flavor or even chocolate in them. Something radical that our parents didn't drink. Dr. Pepper always reminds me of that cherry fountain Coke flavor.

I still recall the soda place on the square in the county seat where we would go to get our cherry Coke when I see the buildings now occupied by other stores or empty in some cases. Love those trips back to my land of youth to see things from decades ago. On one recent visit there was a coral 56-57 Thunderbird just like there was when that was a new car back in the day.

My father and his partners opened up a new drugstore in the early 60s and it had a ""modern"" soda fountain. My older brother jerked there. The family story is that on his first day at work he made someone a banana split and asked the customer how it was. The customer informed him that it was excellent but he may want to include a banana the next time. Don't remember the CoColas (preferred the six ounce ones in the six cent machine in the old store) but the tuna salad was outstanding.

Now there's a blast from the past. My father, who was a mechanic, worked at a new car dealership (Mopar) in a small town where I grew up. We lived out in the country, and I rode a bus to school. Some days, after school, I would walk down to the dealership and hang around until quitting time, then ride home with my father.

The dealership had a Coke machine, with the 6 ounce Cokes for 6 cents.

And parking on a hill -- I may have told this story before, but anyway ..

My first car was a 49 Chevrolet. It had been converted from 6 volt to 12 volt, generator, voltage regulator, light bulbs, etc. But not the starter. Every 6 months or so, the starter would burn out, and I would buy another one at the salvage yard. As I recall, it was about $5, and the salvage yard wanted quite a bit more for a 12 volt starter.

But usually I didn't have the $5, I would have to save it up. Luckily, my house was on a hill, so I could park in the street and roll down hill to jump start. And at school, my friends would help me to push start the car (by hand).

Ah, and soda jerks! My mother graduated high school, in May, 1941, in the same small town. She worked at the drug store, soda jerk, whatever, anything short of filling prescriptions. Until December 7, 1941, after which she joined the WACs.

Yes--turn off the key for 3 seconds to stop the engine then turn the key back to ON without cranking the engine and all accessories, including power steering, are active again were the steering electric. The truck looked like an older Nissan to me which, however, probably has hydraulic steering. In that case, a moving truck would be easily steered without power assist. The brakes would work without the vacuum assist but require strong pressure.

Somehow this truck thing doesn't ring right as runaway. The dispatcher told the person things to do and he didn't do them if I remember the transcipt correctly. During the time people were talking about toyota's runaway acceleration, which most people seem to care little about now, there was a Prius driver whom the toyota folks ridiculed as faking runaway acceleration.

I don't think it was just Toyota people that ridiculed most of the ""runaway acceleration"" drivers.

Driver...should have updated. In the state of OH, you have to go through the BBB arbitration, first. Arbitrator's decision is binding on Cadillac but not me. If I don't like the decision, then Lemon Law Attorney can be used. It's been in front of the arbitration BBB for months. Cadillac simply doesn't respond to their inquiries. As I told them, ""don't wait for Cadillac to call you. You call them."" They're going to do what they're going to do. I still think it's going to take legal action against Cadillac to get them to admit to the car's issues.

I think this is why you don't hear of many Cadillac buybacks. Their whole strategy is to out wait the consumer, in the hopes we will just give up. Wrong guy to try that with. Power steering only acts up once in awhile now. But, getting into a rental car (ANY rental car, regardless of price) just reinforces the difference between correctly operating steering, and the junk they keep telling me is ""operating as designed"".

CUE is still not working. Stalling seems to have stopped, for now.

But, there's a terrible sound coming out from the right front suspension, that the dealership says is a result of the car being on a lift so much. Not sure if they thought that was funny or were serious, but in brief, this $60K Cadillac has been nothing but trouble since they day it first graced my driveway.

The fight continues on.
GG, thanks for the update. It would seem that the BBB is getting nowhere, and really, they don't have a lot of clout. So, when do the Lemon Law people step in? Do they wait until BBB has completely given up trying to get an answer from GM?

That one about the noise being there because of their having the car on the lift to fix it is hilarious. I guess that is your fault for bringing the car in so often.

Obviously, the BBB has done all they can do....they don't even get a reply, I think it is time for the Lemon Law people to try to get some results.

I filled up with Shell PUG this morning.  As I was approaching the gasoline station, a message came up on my NAV screen telling me I was using reserve fuel and wanted to know if I wanted the GPS to search for a gas station.  Problem was I had 3/8 of a tank when I left my brother's house.  Now, my gas gauge was dropping quickly to ""E"".  I pulled into She'll and it took 15.8 gallons which means there was still 6.4 gallons in the tank prior to fill-up.

I get in the car, start it, and gas tank gauge shows empty.  I was on my way to meet my brother at his Mercedes Dealer in Jacksonville.  When I got there I mentioned to the service mgr. the problem.  He plugged in the diagnostic plug and it showed an error message - a miscommunication from the float sensor in the tank.  To fix it, they rocked the car.  Problem solved.  They hand washed my car and off I went with my gauge showing a full tank.
Now that's the old school mechanic stuff I love abet aided by the diagnostic computer. A real old time mechanic would have rocked the car first...or hit it with a hammer.

Of course. I mean, wheels and swaybars aren't covered under warranty anyway (unless you bought a wheel warranty and unless the swaybars are truly defective). As far as RB's buddy with the Cobalt, that's his fault for not knowing the rules. It is on the manufacturer to prove a modification caused the failure, not the responsibility of the customer to show it didn't.

Similar issue with our T&C. Failing headlights and they decided it was my aftermarket trailer harness. I did pay them to go ahead and disconnect it. Didn't fix the problem. I could have taken it home, disconnected it myself, and saved $60, but it wasn't worth the extra trip to me.

Driver....Stick....not sure what happens if Cadillac continues to be unresponsive. In talking to others who have gone the BBB ""buy back"" route with Cadillac, being totally unresponsive isn't unusual. They all had the same thing happen.

For example, one person who had an Escalade (whom I met in the Cadillac service dept) is going through the exact same thing. He's having a problem with the ""check engine"" light coming on....and similar problems as I have with CUE not working. He said Cadillac keeps telling him to bring it back to the dealer, which he has......13 TIMES. Check engine light gets turned off. Cadillac said it's a ""false"" code, and sends him on his way. Few weeks later, it happens again. Same diagnosis.

Clearly, they don't have an answer for the CUE system. The Escalade owner says the same thing.

He's in the same boat. He's been told to take it to arbitration via BBB. I guess if Cadillac doesn't show, we win by default. But, then the decision has to be enforced.

And, I'm thinking that is going to take a lawyer.

So, still a long road ahead.

GG, it seems there should be a point where the BBB says the other party....Cadillac in this case, is not responding so we have to go to the next level. Also, where is the attorney general in all this. They made a program so this wasn't supposed to happen. Cadillac wants to stall until the warranty is over. There should be time limits and ultimatums or the Lemon Law is a joke.

I found in business, if the other party is not cooperative the best weapon is an ultimatum. It sounds nasty and unfair, but, it gets results. And, when you are dealing with arrogant corrupt people it is your best weapon.

If someone didn't pay their bill just begging them seldom works. I would simply say, you have one week to send me a check or I get the collection company after you and I notify your bank.....your choice.

This has dragged on way too long....BBB should be giving you some feedback about what progress they have made (seems like none) and the attorney general should be stepping in by now.

Isn't there a watch dog committee supposed to be seeing if GM is fulfilling their promises? Maybe they should be informed, especially since some of these issues are safety related.

Exactly right.

I first encountered it in the mid-80s at a work party at one of our V-Ps palatial home. Thankfully I wasn't the victim. But a mid-20s accounting clerk brought along a bottle of tequila that she was imbibing from, and the next thing we knew she was in an unconscious heap on the kitchen floor. This was fairly early in the evening too. She was carted off to one of the bedrooms and left to sleep it off. Unfortunately she began spouting like a whale. What a mess, though it seemed quite hilarious at the time. Perhaps you had to be there. Amazingly after that she became somewhat coherent and she was cleaned up as best we could and sent home in a cab. Come Monday back at the office she had no memory of most of the evening but had experienced a 2-day hangover on the weekend, and swore off touching tequila ever again. It had no effect on her career, as I encountered her recently and she is retiring from the same organization at the end of this year!

Cost of ownership is one of the reasons I like our personal watercraft over a boat. Our Yamaha WaveRunner hit 5 years old this summer and the only ""repair"" I've had is replacing the battery for the first time in July. The only maintenance costs have been annual oil changes at $30 in materials. Insurance is a few hundred dollars a year for the two. Both will consume about 8 to 9 gallons of gas a day combined unless we go on cruising outings for distance, and then less than 30 gallons max. They're stored year round in one of our garage bays.

The personal watercraft builders have really upped their competitive game and today's engines are the most advanced on the water with double overhead cams, 4 valves per cylinder, 4 stroke, engine control sensors, etc. They just go and go without much attention.

And then after longer hours of operation, there's tune ups and overhauls.  

He he has a 5 year warranty on the boat and engine, but that's only if the engine sputters or quits or the boat frame is defective.  Nope - not in my budget.

What's happening with the knee?

Thanks for asking, Mike. I'm starting to spend more time at work these days, so that's a good sign things are improving. I hit a plateau in improvement a couple of weeks ago that last through Monday and it really frustrated me. I was stuck at 9 degrees through 115 degrees and no amount of effort would result in progress.

After consulting with the therapist, my wife helped me ""break"" the knee over the weekend. I dosed heavy on the pain killers with a ramp up that gave me two hours of peak blood saturation, and then during that time my wife helped to push and pull the knee beyond the limits. Hurt like crazy even with the pain killers. I joke with friends that my wife laughed through the whole thing, but in reality, she hated the experience more than I did. She doesn't like causing pain.

So, Monday I went in for formal PT, and the measurements came to 2 degrees through 129 degrees! Progress! My goal is 0 through 140, so more work to be done, but I have another 7 weeks to get there before the tissues really lock in place.

Keep healing and improving.  I have faith in you.

In my opinion, here is what is wrong with that deal....it will be in the fine print. The clock started ticking on GGs warranty from the time he bought the first car. If he took a new 2016 model the clock probably would have started from the time he got the first car, because this would be considered part of the original warranty.

The only way I would even consider a deal like that would be 1)the warranty starts when I get the 2016 model 2) if for any reason I decide I still want my money back due to any problems with the car, I want a full refund.

Since there is no way they would go for that, the only real solution is for GG to get his money back.

I thought you were going to comment about gas prices. Here in Midwest prices went from $2.19 as typical high to $2.59.

Driver...should have updated. In the state of OH, you have to go through the BBB arbitration, first. Arbitrator's decision is binding on Cadillac but not me. If I don't like the decision, then Lemon Law Attorney can be used. It's been in front of the arbitration BBB for months. Cadillac simply doesn't respond to their inquiries. As I told them, ""don't wait for Cadillac to call you. You call them."" They're going to do what they're going to do. I still think it's going to take legal action against Cadillac to get them to admit to the car's issues.

I think this is why you don't hear of many Cadillac buybacks. Their whole strategy is to out wait the consumer, in the hopes we will just give up. Wrong guy to try that with. Power steering only acts up once in awhile now. But, getting into a rental car (ANY rental car, regardless of price) just reinforces the difference between correctly operating steering, and the junk they keep telling me is ""operating as designed"".

CUE is still not working. Stalling seems to have stopped, for now.

But, there's a terrible sound coming out from the right front suspension, that the dealership says is a result of the car being on a lift so much. Not sure if they thought that was funny or were serious, but in brief, this $60K Cadillac has been nothing but trouble since they day it first graced my driveway.

The fight continues on.

Installation would depend on the individual dealer; as for coilovers voiding the entire warranty, it shouldn't- but never underestimate the creativity of a lazy dealer looking for a way to avoid warranty work. Back in 2009 in one county where I was working I met a pretrial officer who had bought a brand new Cobalt SS. He added some fog and driving lights and several months later the car's engine started missing and stalling. The dealer wouldn't touch it unless the guy removed all the lighting(or paid them to do it)- they gave him some cr*p about how they wouldn't be able to diagnose it properly. He went up the GM food chain and they backed the dealer all the way. He ended up going to an indie shop who diagnosed it in less than 30 minutes- a bad engine wiring harness that had not been touched during the lighting installation. He paid to have it replaced, GM wouldn't reimburse him, and GM loses another customer for life due to a short-sighted dealer.

3925,October 2015,graphicguy,"Probably have to address all of these manufacturer ""issues"" separate from one another. For example, GM's ignition switch issues are too dissimilar to VW/Audi's futzing the software issue. To me, GM's issues were more related to accounting taking priority over engineering, with their ""almost good enough"" pricing pressures for parts without thought given to performance of the part.

VW/Audi willfully chose to deceive and made tangible steps to do just that with every thought in mind to deceive.

Diesels were never big sellers here in U.S. passenger cars. The market in North America is minuscule for diesel cars, anyway. Rightfully or wrongfully, the additional cost for diesels never could overcome the MPG ROI. Then there was the loud diesel engine clatter, smell and higher pollutants initially, that persist to this day even though they've been largely overcome, made it an awfully tough sell. Even today, with parity in diesel fuel cost vs regular fuel, very few want to buy diesels because the delta in fuel economy between diesels and regular is small these days, if there's any difference at all.

I think it comes from diesels being associated with big semi trucks and industrial applications. Certainly not the type of power plant you want in your refined passenger only vehicle. We just don't care about diesels.

I do think VW/Audi will survive. They must take aggressive steps to rehabilitate their image. Not sure how they would do that other than to publicly fall on their sword and beg forgiveness. The public loves to chastise, but they also love to forgive (ask Pete Rose). I don't think the products would be the same. And, I'll bet they pull out of the diesel market in North America. I'm also betting their market share shrinks dramatically, worldwide. Thoughts of being the ""biggest"" car company in the world should be considered folly at this point.

It may take them a decade to overcome this. You may not recognize them, but they will survive.

The boat is manufactured by Regal - twin propellers and cruises nicely at 29-32 mph (or was it knots?  I forget).  340 hp engine. This huge forklift drops down into the water and you reverse the boat onto the forklift.  The forklift raises the boat out of the water and ever so softly places it on a stationary dry-dock holder/platform.  Then the boat is rinsed off and fresh water is forced into the engine compartment as the engine is idling.  I guess it clears the engine compartment of all seawater.

Then they use the forklift again to raise the boat and the then store it on a shelf indoors.

Yes, boating is very expensive.  The MSRP of his boat was $185,000.  Then there is insurance and then the cost of storage and maintenance.  I'll stick with cars and leave the boating to my brother.

I guess the true story wasn't good enough, so she had to write something that sells better. Unbelievable. I was truly ashamed to show it to anybody (I didn't, I didn't even keep that POS work, although I probably should have - for the posterity), because the stuff she wrote so far from truth that anybody who knew me would think I was a complete Bozo the Clown liar. I had to assure one of other professors that I didn't tell her any of that (he was really ticked off).

You can only imagine my shock. What was really sad, it was probably a journalism student. If they learn already in college to make up stories about real people, how credible do you think they are when they get older and more ""cynical""?

3937,October 2015,suydam,"I'm going to interrupt the endless speculation of VeeDub's future by commenting on a test drive today. I checked out the 2016 Mazda 3 i Touring hatchback with the popular equipment package. Like my Encore, that setup gives you almost everything except Nav and leather seats. It has 16"" alloys instead of 18"" which I actually prefer (not looking forward to the cost of replacing the 18 inchers on the Encore).

I really enjoyed driving it. The hatch felt very light and solid all at the same time. Maneuverability is fantastic -- you can flip a U turn and end up in the closest lane to you going the other way. I had the 2.0 liter and it felt plenty punchy for my style of driving. Also quieter than I remember Mazdas of the past.

The interior is terrific with a couple of exceptions. The tech/infotainment center is the best I've seen so far. I like the joystick/knob in the middle -- avoids the reach to the touch screen like in my Accord. Really easy and intuitive to use. There are some cheap aspects and some really nice ones -- you get leather wrapped steering wheel but the inside door handles seemed pretty low rent, for example.

Overall, I'm just not sure. If we ditched the Accord and got this, we would basically have two small vehicles. Which might be fine. I would really like to try out the new Chevy Volt but I doubt they'll be in the Midwest anytime soon. That might have to wait till we relocate to California. I also love the Buick Verano but the current version gets lousy FE so I'd want to wait for the new one. Between this and the Corolla though, I'd take the Mazda, although the Corolla has more room. I think I want something a little more lux than either of them, however. But not at a high price! There are always tradeoffs!

Take the reporter who ""covered"" the ""story"" about the Duke University LaCrosse team that ""raped"" (not allegedly raped) college coeds at some party.  The entire expose was a sham.

And how was the reporter ""punished"" for not fact-checking her story - or how was the media punished for not checking the reporter's story?  

The media sure showed how slanted and biased it really is - cost the team coach his reputation and his job and what about the young men whose lives were affected beyond repair?

Media outlets just publish retractions - like, ""...oops, we unfairly reported..."" or ""our facts were found to be faulty..."", well after the damage was done.  Then there are just biased media who pounce on a pet political bandwagon as soon as the right opportunity arises.

Not unlike how GM, VW, Takata, Toyota, etc., are reported on.

I love my Tanaka blower and Tanaka string trimmer. They are not exploding!!!

It's the Takata air bags that weren't tested correctly and IIRC the humidity affects the propellant making it explode at a different expansion rate affecting how the metal housing breaks open instead of peeling open. The shrapnel is hard on the people in its way. The problem sounds like they are not sealed correctly. I hope the airbags in my 13-year old leSabre will work correctly.

IIRC Honda or Takata went to junkyards to retrieve airbags to study the problem but didn't report it.

North Florida is approximately the same north latitude as where I am in Houston (29.64N). Tallahassee is 30.39N, Gainesville is 29.69N. And we don't really have ""seasons"" here, the joke is that we have two seasons, summer and not-summer. I expect where you live (around Miami, correct?), you have only summer.

I suspicion there are plenty of places in North Florida that would not cost more than where you live in South Florida. I rather suspect that overall North Florida is cheaper than South Florida. Just sounds to me like your brother is in a really upscale area.

Yes, Ponte Vedra is quite upscale.  My brother lives in the Nocatee area of Ponte Vedra in the Del Webb community (built by Pulte Builders).  His house is a ranch with 2850 square feet of living space (4 bedrooms, 3 full bathrooms, a great room, full dining room, large dining area off the huge kitchen and a screened in patio).  The house's rear abuts a pine tree forest preserve.  All marble floors and columns and 16 foot ceilings in the great room.  

The Del Webb Ponte Vedra community is gated and has a huge country club facility with swimming pools, tennis, dining facilities, etc.  My brother bought here 5 years ago at 1/2 the current build price of his home.  The community is immaculate with forest preserves throughout.  The community is about 47% built out.

TPC Sawgrass is about 10 minutes from here as is the Mayo Cllinic.  The community is about 20 minutes east of of I-95, 18 miles north of St. Augustine and 17 miles south of South Jacksonville in northern St. John's County.  It is about 4 miles from the beach.

I would move here in a minute if my income could support a $300,000 mortgage - but alas, no can do.

driver....you are so right about boats. It's not the purchase price that gets you. It's everything else. My Coastal Cruiser had dual 350 V8s. When they are in or near the water most of the time, regardless of how water proof components are, repairs were often and maintenance quite high. That doesn't account for the electronics (as Mike pointed out, these boats had pretty sophisticated GPS systems), required lighting, safety equipment, and what essentially is a house on the water, and what that entails to keep everything working properly. Then there's not only the fuel for the motors (which were quite thirsty), but fuel/batteries for the hot water heater, electricity, stove, HVAC, etc. You pay for that while docked. But, if you're traveling on the water, all those things still need juice. You par for that. Docking fees, waste disposal fees, insurance, and on and on and on.

One summer, I let a friend captain the boat for awhile after his continued insistence. Result? He hit a rather small log on the river. The boat itself didn't have a problem with it, but the two props that ran over it bent. You have to pull the boat out of the water. Pull the old props off. New props back on. Lower back into the water. B.O.A.T stands for ""Bust Out Another Thousand"".

Loved it the years I had it. Glad I no longer have it.

Heard from Cadillac Customer Service yesterday. They asked me how they could resolve my issues. Not like I haven't told them, and wrote to them....oh....probably about a gazillion times.

I don't think the Customer Service rep knows what a CTS-V is, but she said she would communicate my offer to purchase my car back, or give me a CTS-V. I think we all know what that answer will be.

This was the beginning of posts by some posters that show they 'get it.' I said earlier that I'm watching for the anti-VW/Audi posts to demand that the company not be allowed to sell in the US because of their repeat, flagrant violations of EPA rules. I suppose that ain't gonna happen. As I suspected, the animosity toward VW/Audi is mitigated by many who like them. Contrast to the case of GM where the mainstream auto media folks in the magazines actually worked to ridicule GM because the public had been conditioned to accept such generalizations without questioning their truth or falsehood. So when GM's ignition switch problems surfaced, it was full criticism ahead. But only a few indicated they felt criticism was too much at the time. Hmmmm.
On the other hand, many tossed in that the government should have just let them disappear in 09 rather than bailing out GM or C, and let the auto industry suffer whatever happened due to their suppliers for all the ""good"" companies going bankrupt.

The summary of the point is that many people felt and still feel it's okay to criticize GM for their mistakes or weaknesses but it's not okay to criticize some others except in statements that include mitigation factors. Note that no one has been charged criminally in the GM tragedy. Will someone be charged in VW/Audi? It's not their first rodeo with fooling with the US EPA or was it just the European standards they bypassed earlier.

It's not a matter of just being quick to criticize GM's cars or mock them in the case of the auto media, it's that cars that are competent are just ignored as if they don't exist. When people list off suggestions to others as to what cars to look at, they often mention cars they have 'heard' are reliable from the same media, the reliability factors based on historical empirical judgements, rather than suggesting people shop and test drive several cars.

In closing, what's interesting is folks who supported GM against criticism were pointed out as unusual in this forum. But I've watched and there are other brands that folks would make comments to support, as they should, when they felt the comments needed balancing. They weren't pointed out as the exception. Remember, all cars put their wheels on one lug nut at a time.

I do think the GM ignition switch issue is much worse if we are to rate the two. The faulty ignition switches were known about for over a decade, and many lives were lost. GM could have come forward and tried to correct the problem....maybe lives could have been saved.

The VW issue could cause lives to be lost but indirectly. This scandal is one of poorer mileage and less horsepower. It is bad and I don't condone cheating. But lives may have been lost but that may be a stretch, in GMs case lives were lost and GM wouldn't admit to the fault...even though they knew what was wrong.

3964,October 2015,tyguy,"Changing the subject just a bit, I ran across a decent article on the new Chevy Volt that's worth a read:

hybridcars.com/2016-chevrolet-volt-review-first-drive/

I do believe Chevy has now built the most advanced battery involved power train ever created. The BMW i3 is essentially a copy of the old Volt in that it's primarily battery powered, but there's a motor generator (option for the i3) that generates electricity which is transferred to the battery. The motor is not connected to the wheels, so it's a range extended electric vehicle. Hybrids on the other hand, like the Prius, have a motor indirectly attached to the wheels which can supply surplus torque to generate electricity while powering the wheels. Amazingly the Volt can do all three scenarios. It can drive on battery alone, it can use the motor to generate electricity without engaging the wheels, and it can use the motor to drive the wheels through the transmission while generating electricity for the battery. That's incredible and defies categorization since it's both a hybrid and a range extended electric vehicle.

I've been shopping for a replacement for our 2012 Impreza to purchase in the next year, but I'm split between two vehicle types. Part of me wants to go fun and purchase a manual transmission hatch, and the GTI was at the top of the list until the recent scandal and will no longer be considered. The upcoming Honda SI will likely fill that ""fun"" option, or a WRX if Subaru pulls their heads out of their backends and builds a hatch version.

The other side of me is ready to go electric. The current batch of affordable electrics are too short on range, and the BMW i3 is plain old ugly. I could wait for the upcoming 200-mile electrics and probably will to see what they offer. However, this new Volt is really appealing. At 53 miles electric range the only time I'd have to dip into the gas reserves would be on my drives to the airport, and even then I'd only use 1/2 gallon round trip, and the occasional road trip which the 200-mile electrics wouldn't be suitable for. So, the Volt is now at the top of the electric list. It'll be March before they hit Colorado, though, so there's some time to see what else comes out.

The media I was referring to is us posters. There's a ton of ""user generated content"" out there now and often you can get the ""real"" story from all the posts and Tweets. Lots of reporters get their background facts from those same sources now.

In the old days, you had op-eds and letters to the editors, broadsheets and word of mouth if you didn't believe the papers or radio. Word of mouth goes a lot farther these days.

In other news, VW is saying the recall fix will begin (worldwide) in January and will go through all of 2016. The fix will depend on the country - some engines will just get software update, others will require hardware."

I bash all car makers equally when they cheat the system or play with my life. I would never say I will never buy a certain vehicle again because of a scandal, there are many factors to consider. I do think the GM ignition switch issue is much worse if we are to rate the two. The faulty ignition switches were known about for over a decade, and many lives were lost. GM could have come forward and tried to correct the problem....maybe lives could have been saved. The VW issue could cause lives to be lost but indirectly. This scandal is one of poorer mileage and less horsepower. It is bad and I don't condone cheating. But lives may have been lost but that may be a stretch, in GMs case lives were lost and GM wouldn't admit to the fault...even though they knew what was wrong. There are degrees of guilt and one crime is much worse than the other IMHO.

Well, we are leaving for South Jacksonville and the inter coastal waterway to go boating.  His boat (30') is at a marina.  He calls them 30 minutes before our expected arrival time.  They uncover his boat and lower it into the water.  They fill the boat with ice, beer, soft drinks (whatever you request).  They clean the onboard bathroom and prepare the boat for use.

When we arrive, we just park the car, check in, and they assist us in undocking.  Then, we're off.  His boat holds 160 gallons of marine fuel and his engines and propellers provide stern steering.  He gets 2 miles per gallon at cruising speed.

Hopefully the weather will continue to cooperate (82 degrees and partly cloudy). My brother said I should bring a sweatshirt as it gets cool and breezy at times.

I'm really looking forward to this - I haven't been boating for many, many years.
About a dozen years ago, I had a 46' Blue Water Coastal Cruiser. It really was way too much boat for the Ohio River, but I would sail her just about every weekend to surrounding areas in KY, IN, TN. Had a great time in the boat. Was on it every weekend with family and friends when the weather was nice. It had a head, a shower, a kitchen, a dining room, 2 bedrooms with fold outs in the living room to convert to a 3rd bedroom.

Back in the early '00s, I would fill it up for about $350-$400, which would last a weekend or two, depending on if I kept her close to Cincinnati or decided to take her to TN, for example.

I had her for about 4 years. But, the old adage is true. The happiest days of having a boat is the day you buy her and the day you sell her. Upkeep on a boat that's in the water year round isn't for the weak of wallet.

Still....lots of really good memories I'll never forget.

Have fun, Mike!

Like I say bean, I bash where it is deserved. But, I don't think Honda can be faulted for the Tanaka airbags. At some point they have to trust that their suppliers will be giving them products built to the correct standards. There would be no way to test as most of the airbags work as intended, only some were at fault....and they claim only in warm climates but that seems to be suspicious.

I don't think Honda was guilty of anything unless they knew the airbags were faulty and covered it up, but I don't recall that being the case. It's a case of the Black Swan Theory*. You can't prepare for something that you didn't ever expect would happen.

*Black Swan Theory was invented because the only Swans people ever saw were always white, then one day someone found a black Swan. Up until then everyone assumed all Swans were white.

I must be looking at different Fords. Recently I was in traffic and a new Fusion inched up and stopped alongside me. It was black, and it had some amazingly bad orange peel on the rear quarters and trunklid. I presume it was factory paint though obviously I don't know for sure. But it sure jumped out at me.
Maybe it was that new paint style that looks like the car was dipped in tree sap. A friend at work has a black Ford with that paint as does a woman who owns a black Chrysler 300. I don't have the heart to tell them how bad I think it looks.

Yes. Agree. The compounding of errors in judgement by the engineer who changed the friction/resistance specfications on the lobes of the switch along with high ups who knew there was a connection with some accidents and the switch led to sad tragedy. And I doubt it's the first time a car company has had feet in sand on admitting problems involving injuries and safety of humans. But that does NOT make it right. I am surprised that no one, so far, has been charged in some way in criminal court. Note, that GM did step up to pay in the end with an impartial person to judge the claims. But still sad.

The VW issue could cause lives to be lost but indirectly. This scandal is one of poorer mileage and less horsepower. It is bad and I don't condone cheating.

We have yet to see how severe the problem becomes for VW. I still think gasoline pollution needs to be double checked in vehicles, including VW/Audis. A dog doesn't change its spots. Also remember Hyundia/Kia's having to pay owners a check regularly based on how many miles they drive for reduction of real mileage from advertised mileage. A friend is always happy to talk about the check he gets as a refund for fuel costs on his Elantra.

With GM and the negative publicity often compounded by print media in the auto world, the loss in value of the automobiles was/is not recoverable by owners. It's all lumped in as JANG by writers in many sources most of which are performance oriented mags (Just Ain't No Good--from Swallen's return slips, a family-owned group of stores in Cincinnati that sold everything from furniture to hardware to cameras to nuts). It appears that reducing pollutants from dirty diesels will involve substantial loss of power. Owners may just have to lump it.

Had a Honda driver try to take out my Malibu after I picked up the mail at the PO box. She pulled out of a drive right in front of me. The superb brakes allowed me to stop short of her door. The accident avoidance light never went off, but she was not in front of me where the sensors read. I had never heard the ABS system operate on the Malibu; it's completely different than in my previous leSabres. It sounded like frozen slush dragging against the bottom of the car in a deep slush situation in the winter.

She gave me the one finger salute as my right front fender was 2 feet from her driver door! Women drivers, shhhhhhhhsh. Oh, the driveway was to the city police department and offices. I'm going to check the lot today to see if that car is there again. How can someone not see a black Malibu coming at them in the middle of the day. It doesn't even have enough miles for a normal oil change yet!!!

One figure salute? Even though she pulled in front of you? What's the world coming too? This morning I had a woman tailgating me in a big Lexus SUV. I was in the far right lane doing 5 over but she clung to my bumper while she checked her texts. To be fair, a male driver in a state line painting truck tailgated my bus in the same area a few hours later.

Yup. Sitting at a 45-degree angle half pulled out into my lane and my front fender about 2 feet back from her rental car silver door. Of course, I had hit the horn after I had hit the brakes and I did continue tooting a few times. Usually people pull their car back to allow right-of-way. She just gave a salute and continued on in front of me. I'm going to check to see if that cars in the parking lot at various times. Might be city worker.

You should be upset with Takata and not Honda. Takata provides the airbags for many makes and models.

We got a recall letter on our 2003 CRV for the airbag problem. I called and they had me bring it in a couple of days later. They handed me the keys to a rental car that was no charge and four hours later, I picked up the car!

Our 2004 Toyota Avalon is another story. It too is affectd by the recall. Toyota has no idea when they will get airbags in stock! They tell me I will get a letter ""sometime"". They told me the inventory is going to states first that have high heat and humidy because that is where the majority of problem come from.

So, I continue to drive the car and no, I'm not worried. Most recalls are a tempest in a teapot."

Definitely. Germans (Austrians and Slavs for that matter, too) in general are very direct in their communications, much more direct than Americans, not to mention British. Their style comes in translation similar to that of military. In this case I think it's prudent to not understate the threats and even overstate them somewhat, so your troops are fully aware of what may be coming. There may be other layers in that, too, like labor relations with very comabtive unions in Germany (they may be willing to offer more concessions if convinced that it is a big deal), goverments (please punish us, but don't put us out of business) and business partners (give us more leeway in this and that). The worst they could do would be to come across as aloof, disconnected, or arrogant.

The EPA in the US needs to be demanding in their requirements for fixing these polluters.
When they are putting coal-fired electrical generation plants that have already been cleaned
up substantially so that the greens can try to force expensive solar and wind electricity,
and the same coal goes to China to burn and pollute, then were need to fix the
diesel polluters even though we can't visually see the ""rolling coal"" effect.

And they need to check for pollution on other vehicles produced by VW/Audi
that are not diesel. I saw a post in another forum that a major company had
""adjusted"" the combined mileage for a 2016 model down under the cover that
they had changed the idle to smooth it out. No company gratuitously lowers
that mileage that's going to be on every Mahoney sticker and every advertisement
just to smooth the idle. No one. So I offer that they may have decided to
correct a ""miscalculation"" they had made in light of VW/Audi's current
public debacle.

I think it is not too far fetched. The politicians enact very aggressive targets like it's nothing and stay deaf to warnings about costs (to be fair, lobbiests exaggerrate them) of mandatory increased mileage, improved safety, or lowered emissions. Manufacturers could only object to some point, then they simply had to make their product to comply. The issue may not be whether they could or could not produce properly compliant product, but whether they could hit the proper price range. Politicians and activist always say their projects will ""only"" cost a few bucks per car, but it is all cumulative and new mandates come in fast and furious these days.

There are certain realities out there - you can only sell so many units at a given point, but if you need more to stay profitable, you have hard choices to make. Cheating becomes a compelling option, only reinforced when you get away with it early on.

It would not surprise me if things were much more rotten across the board, but I'm afraid we won't know. When you read those phenomenal specs of the new dowsized engines, it has to come at expense of something - most obvious is durability,

It rarely starts big. It usually starts as a small trangression and grows with every successful try. My guess they cheated on Euro tests first, which were much less restrictive. Perhaps for a long time. When American EPA new standards rolled in, the ""solution"" presented itself as ""obvious"". This is a theory only, I have no evidence, just a logical guess for a scenario.

Funny thing about that color. It looks different with different lighting. On cloudy days it looks almost maroon. In bright sun it's candy apple red. Looks different if you wear sunglasses. Go figure.

I'm going to go to local Ford store to xx see the color on various models to see if there's difference.

I'm pretty sure it's the same color across the board, at least in name. It may look a little different model to model though. I know the specific color on our Mustang, Deep Impact Blue, is available on several Ford models. I see a lot of Explorers and Escapes in this hue.

Did you ever post a picture of your Mustang? I've recently seen some new ones around in colors I thought wouldn't be my first choice (like Guard) and they look really good. Perhaps that car has the right ""bones"" which makes it look good in any color unlike my 4th generation Eclipse which I only thought looked good in red or black.

My friends S8 Audi looks deep chocolate brown from some angles, then you walk around and it seems to be a deep gray color. I still see some of the nicest blues and other colors on the most economical cars...mainly Hyundais and Chevy Cruze.

4012,October 2015,graphicguy,"Gonna make a broad, general statement. But, I think Ford has learned to put paint on their vehicles that is equal to the likes of Lexus (who to me is at the pinacle of paint schemes I've observed on cars).
